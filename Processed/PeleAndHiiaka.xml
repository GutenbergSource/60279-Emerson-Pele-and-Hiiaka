<pb id="pbv" n="V"/></p></div1><div1 id="pre" type="Preface"><head>PREFACE</head><p rend="initial-offset(5px) initial-width(100px) initial-height(95px) initial-image(images/initial-t.png)">The story of Pele and her sister Hiiaka stands at the fountain-head of Hawaiian myth and is the matrix from which the unwritten literature of Hawaii drew its life-blood. The material for the elaboration of this story has, in part, been found in serial contributions to the Hawaiian newspapers during the last few decades; in part, gathered by interviews with the men and women of the older regime, in whose memory it has been stored and, again, in part, it has been supplied by papers solicited from intelligent Hawaiians. The information contained in the notes has been extracted by <hi>viva voce</hi> appeal to Hawaiians themselves. These last two sources of information will soon be no longer available.
</p><p>Merely as a story, this myth of Pele and her kindred may be deemed to have no compelling merit that should attract one to its reading. The cycle of world-myth already gathered from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north pole to the south pole, is quite vast enough, and far in excess of the power of any one scholar to master and digest. It contains enough pretty stories, in all conscience, to satisfy the demands of the whole raft of storiologists and penny-a-liners, ever on the alert to cram the public with new sensations, without making it necessary to levy upon Hawaii for her little contribution.
</p><p>It is not from a disposition to pander to any such appetite that the writer has drudged through many long years in collecting and giving literary shape to the material herein presented. The people who settled the Hawaiian group of islands are recognized as having occupied a unique station, one so far removed from the center and vortex of Polynesian activity as to enable them to cast a highly important side-light on many of the problems yet unsolved, that are of interest to ethnologists and philologists and that still enshroud the Polynesian race.
</p><p>Hawaii rejoiced in a Kamehameha, who, with a strong hand, welded its discordant political elements into one body and made of it a nation. But it was denied a Homer capable of voicing its greatest epic in one song. The myth of the volcanic queen, like every other important Hawaiian myth, has been handled by many poets and raconteurs, each from his own point of view, influenced, no doubt, by local environment; but there never stood <pb n="VI"/>forth one singer with the supreme power to symphonize the jarring notes and combine them into one concordant whole. This fact is a tribute to the independent attitude of Hawaii&#8217;s geographical units as well as to its scattered minstrelsy.
</p><p>This book does not offer itself as a complete history of Pele; it does not even assume to present all the oli, mele, and pule that deal with the great name of Pele. There were important events in her life that will receive but incidental mention. Of such is the story of Pele&#8217;s relations with the swine-god Kama-pua&#8217;a. As indicated in the title, the author confines his attention almost wholly to the story of Pele&#8217;s relations with Prince Lohiau of Haena, in which the girl Hiiaka became involved as an accessory.
</p><p>It was inevitable that such a myth as that of Pele should draw to it and, like an ocean-reef, become the stranding ground of a great mass of flotsam and jetsam poetry and story. Especially was this true of those passional fragments of Hawaiian mele and oli, which, without this, would not easily have found a concrete object to which they might attach themselves.
</p><p>It matters not whether the poet-philosopher, deep pondering on the hot things of love, hit upon Pele as the most striking and appropriate character to serve his purpose and to wear his garment of passionate song and story, or, whether his mind, working more objectively, took Nature&#8217;s suggestion and came to realize that, in the wild play of the volcanic forces, he had exemplified before him a mighty parable of tempestuous love. Certain it is that the volcano was antecedent to the poet and his musings, and it seems more reasonable to suppose that from it came the first suggestion and that his mind, as by a flash of inspiration, began its subjective work as the result of what he saw going on before his eyes.
</p><p>The Hawaiian to whose memory was committed the keeping of an old time mele regarded it as a sacred trust, to be transmitted in its integrity; and he was inclined to look upon every different and contradictory version of that mele as, in a sense, an infringement of his preserve, a desecration of that sacred thing which had been entrusted to him. It resulted from this that such a thing as a company of haku-mele (poets or song-makers) conferring together for the purpose of settling upon one authoritative version of a historic mele was an impossibility.
</p><p>It is a misfortune when the myth-cycle of any people or country is invaded for exploitation by that class of writers whose sole object is to pander, or cater&#8212;to use a softer term&#8212;to the public <pb n="VII"/>taste for novelty and sensation, before that cycle has been canvassed and reported upon by students who approach it in a truthful yet sympathetic spirit. In other words: plain exposition should come before sensational exploitation. To reverse the order would be as undesirable as to have M&#252;nchausen gain the ear of the public before Mungo Park, Livingston, Stanley, Cook, or Vancouver had blazed the way and taken their observations.
</p><p>Fortunately for Hawaii, the spirit of the times has set its face like a flint against this sort of sensation-mongering, and if a M&#252;nchausen were now to claim the public ear he would have the searchlight of scientific investigation turned upon him as pitilessly as it was done in the case of an alleged claim to the discovery of the north pole.
</p><p>It is a satisfaction to the author, after having accomplished his pioneer work of opening up a new domain, to bid the public enter in and enjoy the delicious lehua parks once claimed by the girl Hiiaka as her own; and he can assure them that there yet remain many coverts that are full of charm which are to this day unravaged by the fires of Pele.
</p><p>Thanks, many thanks, are due from the author&#8212;and from us all&#8212;to the men and women of Hawaiian birth whose tenacious memories have served as the custodians of the material herein set forth, but who have ungrudgingly made us welcome to these remainder biscuits of mythological song and story, which, but for them, would have been swallowed up in the grave, unvoiced and unrecorded.

<pb n="IX"/></p></div1><div1 id="intro" type="Introduction"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p rend="initial-offset(5px) initial-width(100px) initial-height(95px) initial-image(images/initial-a.png)">According to Hawaiian myth, Pele, the volcanic fire-queen and the chief architect of the Hawaiian group, was a foreigner, born in the mystical land of Kuai-he-lani, a land not rooted and anchored to one spot, but that floated free like the Fata Morgana, and that showed itself at times to the eyes of mystics, poets and seers, a garden land, clad with the living glory of trees and habitations&#8212;a vision to warm the imagination. The region was known as Kahiki (Kukulu o Kahiki), a name that connotes Java and that is associated with the Asiatic cradle of the Polynesian race.
</p><p>Pele&#8217;s mother was Haumea, a name that crops up as an ancestor in the hoary antiquity of the Hawaiian people, and she was reputed to be the daughter of Kane-hoa-lani.
</p><p>Pele was ambitious from childhood and from the earliest age made it her practice to stick close to her mother&#8217;s fireplace in company with the fire-keeper Lono-makua, ever watchful of his actions, studious of his methods&#8212;an apprenticeship well fitted to serve her in good stead such time as she was to become Hawaii&#8217;s volcanic fire-queen. This conduct drew upon Pele the suspicion and illwill of her elder sister Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#8217;i, a sea-goddess, who, fathoming the latent ambition of Pele, could not fail to perceive that its attainment would result in great commotion and disturbance in their home-land.
</p><p>Her fears and prognostications proved true. Namaka, returning from one of her expeditions across the sea, found that Pele, taking advantage of her absence, had erupted a fiery deluge and smothered a portion of the home-land with a&#228;.
</p><p>It would have gone hard with Pele; but mother Haumea bade her take refuge in the fold (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pola</hi>) of Ka-moho-alii&#8217;s malo. Now this elder brother of Pele was a deity of great power and authority, a terrible character, hedged about with tabus that restricted and made difficult the approach of his enemies. Such a refuge could only be temporary, and safety was to be assured only by Pele&#8217;s removal from her home in the South land, and that meant flight. It was accomplished in the famed mythical canoe Honua-i-a-kea.
</p><p>The company was a distinguished one, including such godlike beings as Ka-moho-alii, Kane-apua, Kane-milo-hai and many <pb n="X"/>other relations of Pele, the youngest, but not the least important, of whom was the girl Hiiaka, destined to be the heroine of the story here unfolded and of whom it was said that she was born into the world as a clot of blood out of the posterior fontanelle (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">nunoi</hi>) of her mother Haumea, the other sisters having been delivered through the natural passage.
</p><p>The sailing course taken by Pele&#8217;s company brought them to some point northwest of Hawaii, along that line of islets, reefs, and shoals which tail off from Hawaii as does the train of a comet from its nucleus. At Moku-pap&#225;pa Pele located her brother Kane-milo-hai, as if to hold the place for her or to build it up into fitness for human residence, for it was little more than a reef. Her next stop was at the little rock of Nihoa that lifts its head some eight hundred feet above the ocean. Here she made trial with the divining rod Paoa, but the result being unfavorable, she passed on to the insignificant islet of Lehua which clings like a limpet to the flank of Niihau. In spite of its smallness and unfitness for residence, Pele was moved to crown the rock with a wreath of kau-no&#8217;a, while Hiiaka contributed a chaplet of lehua which she took from her own neck, thus christening it for all time. The poet details the itinerary of the voyage in the following graphic lines:

</p><p>The Paoa mentioned in verse eight was a divining rod used to determine the suitability of any spot for Pele&#8217;s excavations. The land must be proof against the entrance of sea water. It also served as a spade in excavating for a volcanic crater.
</p><p>When a suitable place was finally discovered on Hawaii, the Paoa staff was planted in Panaewa and became a living tree, multiplying itself until it was a forest. The writer&#8217;s informant says that it is a tree known to the present generation of men. &#8220;I have seen sticks cut from it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but not the living tree itself.&#8221;</p></note>

(The words of Pele in the second verse of the kaao next to be given lead one to infer that she must for a time have entertained the thought that they had found the desired haven at Pele-ula&#8212;a small land-division within the limits of the present city of Honolulu.)

But here again she was dissatisfied with the result. She had not yet delivered herself from the necessity of protection by her kinsman, Ka-moho-alii: &#8220;One girdle yet serves for you and for me,&#8221; was the note that still rang out as a confession of dependence, in her song.
</p><p>While Pele was engaged in her operations in the crater of Hale-a-ka-la, her inveterate enemy Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#8217;i, who had trailed her all the way from Kahiki with the persistency of a sea-wolf, appeared in the offing, accompanied by a sea-dragon named Ha-ui.
</p><p>The story relates that, as Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#8217;i passed the sand-spit of Moku-pap&#225;pa, Kane-milo-hai, who, it will be remembered, had been left there in charge as the agent of Pele, hailed her with the question: &#8220;Where are you going so fast?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;To destroy my enemy, to destroy Pele,&#8221; was her answer.
</p><p>&#8220;Return to Kahiki, lest you yourself be destroyed,&#8221; was the advice of Kane-milo-hai.

The contest was terrific. The sea-monster, aided by her dragon consort, was seemingly victorious. Dismembered parts of Pele&#8217;s body were cast up at Kahiki-nui, where they are still pointed out as the bones of Pele (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">na iwi o Pele</hi>.) (She was only bruised). Ka-moho-alii was dismayed thinking Pele to have been destroyed;&#8212;but, looking across the Ale-nui-haha channel, he saw the spirit-form of Pele flaming in the heavens above the summits of Mauna-loa and Mauna-kea. As for Na-maka-o-ka-ha&#8217;i, she retired from the battle exultant, thinking that her enemy Pele was done for: but when she reported her victory to Kane-milo-hai, that friend of Pele pointed to the spirit body of Pele glowing in the heavens as proof that she was mistaken. Namaka was enraged at the sight and would <pb n="XV"/>have turned back to renew the conflict, but Kane-milo-hai dissuaded her from this foolhardy undertaking, saying, &#8220;She is invincible; she has become a spirit.&#8221;
</p><p>The search for a home-site still went on. Even Hale-a-ka-la was not found to be acceptable to Pele&#8217;s fastidious taste. According to one account it proved to be so large that Pele found herself unable to keep it warm. Pele, a goddess now, accordingly bade adieu to Maui and its clustering isles and moved on to Hawaii.

    </l><l>Hiiaka, the wise, the darling of Pele.</l></lg><p rend="noindent">Pele and her company landed on Hawaii at Pua-k&#243;, a desolate <pb n="XVI"/>spot between Kawaihae and Kailua. Thence they journeyed inland until they came to a place which they named Moku-aweo-weo&#8212;not the site of the present crater of that name, but&#8212;situated where yawns the vast caldera of Kilauea. It was at the suggestion of Ku-moku-halii and Keawe-nui-kau of Hilo that the name was conferred. They also gave the name Mauna-loa to the mountain mass that faced them on the west, &#8220;because,&#8221; said they, &#8220;our journey was long.&#8221;
</p><p>Night fell and they slept. In the morning, when the elepaio uttered its note, they rose and used the Paoa staff. The omens were favorable, and Pele decided that this was the place for her to establish a permanent home.
</p><p>The people immediately began to set out many plants valuable for food; among them a variety of kalo called awe&#252;, well suited for upland growth; the ulu (<hi>bread-fruit</hi>); the mai&#228; (banana); the pala-&#225; (an edible fern); the awa (<hi lang="la-x-bio" xml:lang="la-x-bio">Piper methysticum</hi>) and other useful plants.
</p><p>The land on the Hilo side of Kilauea, being in the rain belt, is fertile and well fitted for tillage. The statement, however, that Kilauea, or its vicinity, became the place of settlement for any considerable number of people cannot be taken literally. The climatic conditions about Kilauea are too harsh and untropical to allow either the people or the food plants of Polynesia to feel at home in it. The probability is that instead of being gathered about Kilauea, they made their homes in the fat lands of lower Puna or Hilo.
</p><p>Pele, on her human side at least, was dependent for support and physical comfort upon the fruits of the earth and the climatic conditions that made up her environment. Yet with all this, in the narrative that follows her relations to humanity are of that exceptional character that straddle, as it were, that border line which separates the human from the superhuman, but for the most part occupy the region to the other side of that line, the region into which if men and women of this work-a-day world pass they find themselves uncertain whether the beings with whom they converse are bodied like themselves or made up of some insubstantial essence and liable to dissolve and vanish at the touch.

<pb id="pb1" n="1"/></p></div1></front><body><div1 id="ch1" n="I" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER I</head><head>PELE IN THE BOSOM OF HER FAMILY</head><p>Once, when Pele was living in the pit of Kilauea, she roused up from her couch on the rough hearth-plate and said to her sisters, &#8220;Let us make an excursion to the ocean and enjoy ourselves, open the opihi shells and sea-urchins, hunt for small squid and gather sea-moss.&#8221;
</p><p>To this all joyfully assented, saying, &#8220;Yes, let us go.&#8221;
</p><p>The sisters formed quite a procession as they tramped the narrow downhill path until they came to the hill Pu&#8217;u-Pahoehoe&#8212;a place in the lower lands of Puna. Pele herself did not visibly accompany them on this journey; that was not according to her custom: she had other ways and means of travel than to plod along a dusty road. When, however, the party arrived at the rendezvous, there, sure enough, they found Pele awaiting them, ready for the business in hand.
</p><p>In the midst of their pleasurings Pele caught sight of Hopoe and Haena as they were indulging in an <hi>al fresco</hi> dance and having a good time by the Puna sea. She was greatly pleased and, turning to her sisters, said, &#8220;Come, haven&#8217;t you also got some dance that you can show off in return for this entertainment by Hopoe and her companion?&#8221;
</p><p>They all hung their heads and said, &#8220;We have no hula.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka, the youngest, had stayed behind to gather lehua flowers, and when she came along laden with wreaths, Pele said to her, jestingly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been proposing to your sisters here to dance a hula in response to that of Hopoe and her fellow, but they decline, saying they have not the art. I suppose it&#8217;s of no use to ask you, you are so small; but, perhaps, you&#8217;ve got a bit of a song.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, I have a song,&#8221; Hiiaka answered, to the surprise of all.
</p><p>&#8220;Let us have it, then; go on!&#8221; said Pele.
</p><p>Then the little girl, having first decorated all of her sisters with the wreaths, beginning with Pele, sang as follows:
</p><lg id="lg1.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Ke ha&#8217;a la Puna i ka makani;

    </l><l>Haena and Hopoe are swaying;

    </l><l>Quiver and sway, down at Nana-huki&#8212;
    </l><l>A dance most sightly and pleasing,
    </l><l>Down by the sea Nana-huki.</l></lg><p>Pele was delighted. &#8220;Is that all you have?&#8221; she asked.
</p><p>&#8220;I have <corr sic="somthing">something</corr> more,&#8221; said the girl.
</p><p>&#8220;Let us hear it then.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka put even more spirit into the song as she complied:
</p><lg id="lg2.2" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O Puna kai kuw&#225; i ka hala;

</p><lg id="lg2.3" type="Group"><l>The voice of Puna&#8217;s sea resounds
    </l><l>Through the echoing hala groves;
    </l><l>The lehua trees cast their bloom.
    </l><l>Look at the dancing girl Hopoe;
    </l><l>Her graceful hips swing to and fro,
    </l><l>A-dance on the beach Nana-huki:
    </l><l>A dance that is full of delight,
    </l><l>Down by the sea Nana-huki.</l></lg><p>At the conclusion of this innocent performance&#8212;the earliest mention of the hula that has reached us&#8212;Hiiaka went to stay with her friend Hopoe, a person whose charm of character had fascinated the imagination of the susceptible girl and who had already become her dearest intimate, her inspiring mentor in those sister arts, song, poesy and the dance.
</p><p>Pele herself remained with her sister Hiiaka-i-ka-pua-enaena (Hiiaka-of-the-fire-bloom), and presently she lay down to sleep <pb id="pb3" n="3"/>in a cave on a smooth plate of pahoehoe. Before she slept she gave her sister this command: &#8220;Listen to me. I am lying down to sleep; when the others return from fishing, eat of the fish, but don&#8217;t dare to wake me. Let me sleep on until I wake of myself. If one of you wakes me it will be the death of you all. If you must needs wake me, however, call my little sister and let her be the one to rouse me; or, if not her, let it be my brother Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua&#8212;one of these two.&#8221;
</p><p>When Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua, who was so closely related to Pele that she called him brother, had received this command and had seen her lapse into profound sleep he went and reported the matter to Hiiaka, retailing all that Pele had said. &#8220;Strange that this havoc-producer should sleep in this way, and no bed-fellow!&#8221; said Hiiaka to herself. &#8220;Here are all the other Hiiakas, all of equal rank and merit! Perhaps it was because my dancing pleased her that she wishes me to be the one to rouse her.&#8221;
</p><p>The cavern in the hill Pahoehoe in which Pele lay and slept, wrapped in her robe (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kapa-ahu</hi>), remains to this day.
</p><p>In her sleep Pele heard the far-off beating of hula drums, and her spirit-body pursued the sound. At first it seemed to come from some point far out to sea; but as she followed, it shifted, moving to the north, till it seemed to be off the beach of Waiakea, in Hilo; thence it moved till it was opposite Lau-pahoehoe. Still evading her pursuit, the sound retreated till it came from the boisterous ocean that beats against the shaggy cliffs of Hamakua. Still going north, it seemed presently to have reached the mid channel of Ale-nui-haha that tosses between Hawaii and Maui.
</p><p>&#8220;If you are from my far-off home-land Kahiki, I will follow you thither, but I will come up with you,&#8221; said Pele.
</p><p>To her detective ear, as she flitted across the heaving waters of Ale-nui-haha, the pulsing of the drums now located itself at the famous hill Kauwiki, in Hana; but, on reaching that place, the music had passed on to the west and sounded from the cliffs of Ka-haku-loa.
</p><p>The fugitive music led her next across another channel, until in her flight she had traversed the length of Moloka&#8217;i and had come to the western point of that island, Lae-o-ka-laau. Thence she flew to cape Maka-pu&#8217;u, on Oahu, and so on, until, after crossing that island, she reached cape Kaena, whose finger-point reaches out towards Kaua&#8217;i. In that desolate spot dwelt an aged creature of myth, Pohaku-o-Kaua&#8217;i by name, the personal representative of that rock whose body-form the hero Mawi <pb id="pb4" n="4"/>had jerked from its ocean bed ages before, in his futile attempt to draw together the two islands Kaua&#8217;i and Oahu and unite them into one mass.
</p><p>Pele, arguing from her exasperation, said, &#8220;It must be my old grandfather Pohaku-o-Kaua&#8217;i who is playing this trick with the music. If it&#8217;s he that&#8217;s leading me this chase, I&#8217;ll kill him.&#8221;
</p><p>The old fellow saw her approach and, hailing her from a distance, greeted her most heartily. Her answer was in a surly mood: &#8220;Come here! I&#8217;m going to kill you to-day. So it&#8217;s you that&#8217;s been fooling me with deceitful music, leading me a wearisome chase.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Not I, I&#8217;ve not done this. There they are, out to sea; you can hear for yourself.&#8221; And, sure enough, on listening, one could hear the throbbing of the music in the offing.
</p><p>Pele acknowledged her mistake and continued her pursuit, with the parting assurance to the old soul that if he <hi>had</hi> been the guilty one, it would have been his last day of life.
</p><p>The real authors of this illusive musical performance were two little creatures named Kani-ka-w&#237; and Kani-ka-w&#225;, the former a sprite that was embodied in the nose-flute, the latter in the hokeo, a kind of whistle, both of them used as accompaniments to the hula. Their sly purpose was to lure Pele to a place where the hula was being performed.
</p><p>Pele now plunged into the water&#8212;from this point at least she swam&#8212;and, guided by the call of the music, directed her course to the little village of Haena that perched like a gull on the cape of the same name, at the northernmost point of the island of Kaua&#8217;i. It was but a few steps to the hall of the hula&#8212;the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">halau</hi>&#8212;where throbbed the hula drums and where was a concourse of people gathered from the whole island.



<pb id="pb5" n="5"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch2" n="II" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER II</head><head>PELE MEETS AND FASCINATES LOHIAU</head><p>As Pele drew near to the rustic hall where the hula was in full blast, the people in the outskirts of the assembly turned to look in wonder and admiration at the beauty and charm of the stranger who had appeared so unexpectedly and whose person exhaled such a fragrance, as if she had been clad with sweet-scented garlands of maile, lehua and hala. One and all declared her to be the most beautiful woman they had ever looked upon. Where was she from? Surely not from Kaua&#8217;i. Such loveliness could not have remained hidden in any nook or corner of the island, they declared.
</p><p>Instinctively the wondering multitude parted and offered a lane for her to pass through and enter the halau, thus granting to Pele a full view of the musicians and performers of the hula, and, sitting in their midst, Lohiau,&#8212;as yet seemingly unconscious of her presence,&#8212;on his either hand a fellow drummer; while, flanking these to right and left, sat players with a joint of bamboo in either hand (the kaekeeke). But drummer and kaekeeke-player, musicians and actors&#8212;aye, the whole audience&#8212;became petrified and silent at the sight of Pele, as she advanced step by step, her eyes fixed on Lohiau.
</p><p>Then, with intensified look, as if summoning to her aid the godlike gifts that were hers as the mistress of Kilauea, she reached out her hand and, in a clear tone, with a mastery that held the listeners spell-bound, she chanted:
</p><lg id="lg5.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Lu&#8217;ulu&#8217;u Hanalei i ka ua nui,

</p><lg id="lg5.2" type="Group"><l>Tight-pressed is Hanalei&#8217;s throng,

    </l><l>My quest was for comfort and life,
    </l><l>Just for comfort and life!</l></lg><p>The silence became oppressive. In the stillness that followed the song expectant eyes were focused upon Prince Lohiau, awaiting his reply to the address of the stranger who stood in their midst. No one knew who she was; no one imagined her to be Pele. That she was a person of distinction and rank was evident enough, one whom it was the duty and rare privilege of their chief to receive and entertain.
</p><p>Presently there was wrinkling of foreheads, an exchange of glances, prompting winks and nods, inclinations of the head, a turning of the eyes&#8212;though not a word was spoken&#8212;; for his friends thought thus to rouse Lohiau from his daze and to prompt him to the dutiful rites of hospitality and gallantry. Paoa, his intimate friend, sitting at Lohiau&#8217;s right hand, with a drum between his knees, even ventured to nudge him in the side.
</p><p>The silence was broken by Pele:

    </l><l>Your companion, your mate!</l></lg><p>Lohiau, once roused from his ecstacy, rose to the occasion and with the utmost gallantry and politeness invited Pele to sit with him and partake of the hospitalities of the halau.
</p><p>When Pele had seated herself on the mat-piled dais, Lohiau, following the etiquette of the country, asked whence she came.
</p><p>&#8220;I am of Kaua&#8217;i,&#8221; she answered.
</p><p>&#8220;There is no woman of Kaua&#8217;i your equal in beauty,&#8221; said Lohiau. &#8220;I am the chief and I know, for I visit every part of the whole island.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;You have doubtless traveled about the whole island,&#8221; answered Pele; &#8220;yet there remain places you are not acquainted with; and that is where I come from.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;No, no! you are not of Kaua&#8217;i. Where <hi>are</hi> you from?&#8221;
</p><p>Because of his importunity, Pele answered him, &#8220;I am from Puna, from the land of the sunrise; from Ha&#8217;eha&#8217;e, the eastern gate of the sun.&#8221;
</p><p>Lohiau bade that they spread the tables for a feast, and he invited Pele to sit with him and partake of the food. But Pele refused food, saying, &#8220;I have eaten.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;How can that be?&#8221; said he, &#8220;seeing you have but now come from a long journey? You had better sit down and eat.&#8221;
</p><p>Pele sat with him, but she persistently declined all his offers of food, &#8220;I am not hungry.&#8221;
</p><p>Lohiau sat at the feast, but he could not eat; his mind was disturbed; his eyes were upon the woman at his side. When they rose from the table he led her, not unwilling, to his house, and he lay down upon a couch by her side. But she would favor him only with kisses. In his growing passion for her he forgot his need of food, his fondness for the hula, the obligations that rested upon him as a host: all these were driven from his head.
</p><p>All that night and the following day, and another night, and for three days and three nights, he lay at her side, struggling with her, striving to overcome her resistance. But she would grant him only kisses.
<pb id="pb8" n="8"/></p><p>And, on the third night, as it came towards morning, Pele said to Lohiau, &#8220;I am about to return to my place, to Puna, the land of the sunrise. You shall stay here. I will prepare a habitation for us, and, when all is ready I will send and fetch you to myself. If it is a man who comes, you must not go with him; but, if a woman, you are to go with the woman. Then, for five days and five nights you and I will take our fill of pleasure. After that you will be free to go with another woman.&#8221;
</p><p>In his madness, Lohiau put forth his best efforts to overcome Pele&#8217;s resistance, but she would not permit him. &#8220;When we meet on Hawaii you shall enjoy me to your fill,&#8221; said she. He struggled with her, but she foiled him and bit him in the hand to the quick; and he grasped the wound with the other hand to staunch the pain. And he, in turn, in the fierceness of his passion, planted his teeth in her body.
</p><p>At this, Pele fluttered forth from the house, plunged into the ocean and&#8212;was gone.



</p></div1><div1 id="ch3" n="III" type="Chapter"><head>CHAPTER III</head><head>LOHIAU COMES TO HIMSELF&#8212;HIS DEATH&#8212;THE THREAT OF PAOA</head><p>When Lohiau came to himself, as from a dream, he looked for the woman who had lain at his side, but her place was vacant and cold. He went out into the open air, but she was nowhere to be found, and he turned back into the empty house.
</p><p>Lohiau&#8217;s stay with Pele in the sleeping house had prolonged itself beyond all reason and his friends became concerned about him; and as night after night and day after day passed and they neither saw nor heard anything of him, their concern grew into alarm. Yet no one dared enter the house. Lohiau&#8217;s sister, however, made it her business to investigate. Opening the door of the house, she entered, and, lo, there hung the body of her brother, suspended from a rafter, his malo about his neck. Life had been gone for many hours and the body was cold. Her screams brought to her aid a group of Lohiau&#8217;s friends who at once lifted their voices in unison with hers, bewailing their chief&#8217;s death and denouncing the woman who had been with him as the guilty cause.
<pb id="pb9" n="9"/></p><p>Paoa was the most outspoken in his imprecations. Stripping off his malo, he stood forth in the garb of nature and declared he would not resume his loin cloth until he had sought out the woman and humiliated her by the grossest of insults. &#8220;I will not gird my loins with a malo until I have kindled a fire in Pele&#8217;s face, pounded her face as one pounds a taro, consumed her very eyes.&#8221; This was the savage oath with which Paoa pledged his determination to avenge the death of his friend, his chief, Lohiau. With universal wailing, amid the waving of kahilis, with tender care and the observance of all due rites, his people anointed the dear body of their chief with perfumed oil, wrapped it in scented robes of choicest tapa, and laid it to rest in the sepulcher.
</p><p>The favorite dog of Lohiau, who was greatly attached to his master, took his station at the grave and would not be persuaded to leave. Poha-kau, a cousin of Pele,&#8212;himself a kupua and possessed of superhuman powers,&#8212;having journeyed from Hawaii to Haena, found the faithful creature keeping his lonely vigil at the grave and he brought the dog with him to Pele.
</p><p>&#8220;Your man is dead; Lohiau is dead,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But this animal&#8212;do you recognize him?&#8212;I found watching by the grave in Haena.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, that is the dog I saw with Lohiau,&#8221; answered Pele; and she hid the dog away in her secret place.



</p></div1><div1 id="ch4" n="IV" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER IV</head><head>PELE AWAKES FROM HER SLEEP</head><p>While the scene we have described was being enacted on Kaua&#8217;i, the spirit of Pele, returning from its long flight, hovered over the sleeping body at Lau-pahoehoe. Above it waved the kahilis, about it were gathered the sisters and other relatives, quietly sobbing. Though it was many days since Pele had lain down to sleep, and though they feared the consequences if she continued thus, they dared not disturb her. When that was proposed, the sister in charge objected. &#8220;If it must be done, we shall have to send for Hiiaka the beloved.&#8221;
</p><p>Some of them suggested that Pele must be dead, she had remained so long without motion. But Hiiaka-of-the-lightning-flash scouted the idea: &#8220;How can that be? The body shows no signs of decay.&#8221;
<pb id="pb10" n="10"/></p><p>The girl Hiiaka saw the messenger that had been despatched to fetch her, while as yet she was in the dim distance,&#8212;it was her nurse, Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e,&#8212;and there came to her a premonition of what it all meant, a vision, a picture, of the trouble that was to come; yet, overmastering her, was a feeling of affection and loyalty for her elder sister. Standing outside the house, that she might better watch the approach of Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e and be on hand to greet her, she voiced her vision in song:
</p><lg id="lg10.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A ka lae ohi&#8217;a i Papa-lau-ahi,

    </l><l>The fire that flows from the Pit.</l></lg><p>As the messenger, in the vibrating sunlight, thridded her way among the tree clumps and lava-knobs, which now concealed her and now brought her into full view, Hiiaka, with gaze intent to gain such snap-shots of her as these obstructions did not forbid, continued her song:

Who in the world is driving you away, as if you had worn out your welcome?&#8221;
</p><p>The messenger, Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e, when she had saluted Hiiaka, said, &#8220;I come from your sisters. They want to see you.&#8221;
</p><p>Arrived at Lau-pahoehoe,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a">This Laupahoehoe is to be distinguished from that in Hilo.</note> Hiiaka found her sisters in great consternation, fearing for the life of Pele if she were allowed to continue her long sleep. Her spirit, it is true, had come back to her body; but it was merely hovering about and had not entered and taken possession, so that there were no signs of animation or life. It seemed to be waiting for the voice of Hiiaka, the belov&#233;d, to summon it back and to make it resume consciousness.
</p><p>Hiiaka demanded to know the cause of the wailing.
</p><p>&#8220;We are lamenting our sister, the head of the family. You can see for yourself; she is dead.&#8221;
</p><p>After carefully examining the body of Pele, Hiiaka stoutly declared, &#8220;She is not dead. That is evident from the absence of corruption.&#8221; Then, sitting close to Pele&#8217;s feet, she sang:

</p></div1><div1 id="ch5" n="V" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER V</head><head>PELE MAKES A PROPOSITION TO HER SISTERS</head><p>That same day Pele and the other sisters returned to Kilauea, while Hiiaka went back to resume her visit with Hopoe, each party reaching its destination at about the same time. Early the next morning Pele called to her sister Hiiaka-i-ka-ale-i (Hiiaka-of-the-choppy-sea) and said, &#8220;I want you to go on an errand for me.&#8221;
<pb id="pb13" n="13"/></p><p>&#8220;No doubt I shall agree to go when you have told me what it is,&#8221; was the answer of the young woman.
</p><p>&#8220;You are to journey to Kaua&#8217;i and escort hither our lover&#8212;yours and mine. While on the way you are not to lie with him; you are not to touch noses with him; you are not to fondle him or snuggle close to him. If you do any such thing I will kill both of you. After your return, for five days and five nights, I will have him to myself, and after that he shall be your lover.&#8221;
</p><p>On hearing this, the young woman hung her head and wept.
</p><p>Pele then made the same proposal to each of the other sisters in turn. Not one of them would consent to undertake the mission. They knew full well the perils of the undertaking: the way was beset with swarms of demons and dragons, with beings possessed with powers of enchantment; and Pele did not offer to endow them with the power that would safeguard them on their journey.
</p><p>Pele, finding herself foiled on this tack, as a diversion, said, &#8220;Let us refresh ourselves and have some luau.&#8221; The sisters immediately set to work, and, when they had made up the bundles of delicate taro leaves and were about to lay them upon the fire, Pele called to Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e and bade her go straightway to Haena and fetch Hiiaka, &#8220;And you are to be back here by the time the luau is cooked.&#8221;
</p><p>Now the girl, whose full name was Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, was the youngest of the sisters, and, by reason of her loveliness and accommodating disposition, she was Pele&#8217;s favorite. She was, moreover, gifted with a quick intuition and a clairvoyant perception of distant happenings and coming events. At the time of the conversation between Pele and the seven sisters, Hiiaka was sporting in the ocean with her surf-board in the company of Hopoe. While thus engaged, the whole matter of the proposed journey to Haena came to her as in a vision. In the midst of her surfing she turned to Hopoe and said, &#8220;I perceive that I am about to undertake a long journey; and during my absence you will remain here in Puna waiting my return.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;No! What puts such a notion into your head?&#8221; said Hopoe.
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, I must go,&#8221; insisted Hiiaka. Then they mounted a roller, and, as their boards touched the beach, there stood the messenger of Pele; and this was the message: &#8220;Gird on your pa&#250; and come with me to Kilauea. Your sister commands it.&#8221;
</p><p>As the two jogged on their uphill way, an impulse seized Hiiaka, and she gave voice to a <corr sic="promonition">premonition</corr>, a shadow of coming <pb id="pb14" n="14"/>trouble, as it were, and, standing in the road at Mokau-lele, she sang:
</p><lg id="lg14.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>He u&#228; kui lehua ko Pana-ewa;

</p><lg id="lg14.3" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O ka manu m&#250;kimuk&#237;,

At its conclusion, Pele turned to the girl Hiiaka and put the question in her blunt way, &#8220;Will you be my messenger to fetch our lover&#8212;yours and mine&#8212;from Kaua&#8217;i? Your sisters here&#8221;&#8212;she glanced severely about the group&#8212;&#8220;have refused to go. Will you do this for me?&#8221;
</p><p>The little maid, true to her sense of loyalty to the woman who was her older sister, the head of the family, and her alii, to the surprise and dismay of her other sisters, answered, &#8220;Yes, I will go and bring the man.&#8221;
</p><p>It was a shock to their sense of fitness that one so young should be sent on an errand of such danger and magnitude; but more, it was a reproof that slapped them in the face to have this little chit accept without hesitation a commission which they had shrunk from through lack of courage. But they dared not say a word; they could but scowl and roll the eye and shrug the shoulder.
</p><p>&#8220;When you have brought our lover here,&#8221; continued Pele, &#8220;for five nights and five days he shall be mine; after that, the tabu shall be off and he shall be yours. But, while on the way, you must not kiss him, nor fondle him, nor touch him. If you do it will be the death of you both.&#8221;
</p><p>In spite of the gestured remonstrances of the group, Hiiaka, in utter self-forgetfulness and diplomatic inexperience, agreed to Pele&#8217;s proposition, and she framed her assent in a form of speech that had in it the flavor of a sacrament:
</p><lg id="lg15.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Kukulu ka makia a ka huaka&#8217;i hele moe ipo:

The next day, while Hiiaka was climbing the long ascent up the crater-pali, her sisters, anxious and appreciating the danger of the undertaking, were quietly weeping outside the cave; but they dared not utter a word that might come to the ears of Pele. They began, however, to beckon and signal to Hiiaka to return. She saw them and turned back, uttering the following plaint:
</p><lg id="lg16.4" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>E ku ana au e hele;

    </l><l>These bad ones sit with impudent stare:
    </l><l>And so it is I that must go!</l></lg><p>The opposition of the sisters was based largely on Hiiaka&#8217;s youth and inexperience. The girl did not understand nor give them credit for this generous regard for herself; she saw only their disobedience and disloyalty to Pele&#8217;s command.
</p><p>Pele, impatient at her vacillation, broke out on her savagely: &#8220;Here you are again! Be off on your journey! You shall find no food here, no meat, no raiment, no roof, no sisterly greeting, nothing, until you return with the man. It would have been useless to dispatch these homely women on this errand; it seems equally useless to send a beautiful girl like you.&#8221;
</p><p>To this outburst Hiiaka retorted:

</p><p>Hiiaka, though a novice in diplomacy, as shown by her instant and unconditional acceptance of Pele&#8217;s proposition, having once got her second breath, now exacted of Pele a condition that proved her to be, under the discipline of experience, an apt pupil in the delicate art of diplomacy. &#8220;I am going to bring our lover, while you remain at home. If during my absence you go forth on one of your raids, you are welcome to ravage and consume the lands that are common to us both; but, see to it that you do not consume my forests of lehua. And, again, if the fit does come upon you and you must ravage and destroy, look to it that you harm not my friend Hopoe.&#8221;
</p><p>Pele readily agreed to Hiiaka&#8217;s reasonable demand, thinking thus to hasten her departure. To the inexperienced girl the terms of the agreement seemed now complete and satisfactory, and, in the first blush of her gratification, Hiiaka gave expression to her pleasure:

</p><p>Pele designated a good-natured waiting woman as her attendant, who had the poetical name of Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e (or Pa&#250;-o-pala&#225;). This faithful creature heartily accepted the trust, that of <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kahu</hi>&#8212;a servant with the pseudo responsibility of a guardian&#8212;and, having expressed her fealty to her new mistress, she at once took her station. Thus everything seemed arranged for a start on the eventful journey.
</p><p>The terms and conditions of Hiiaka&#8217;s going were not even yet to the satisfaction of her watchful sisters and relatives. One matter of vital importance had been omitted from the outfit: Pele had not bestowed upon Hiiaka the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mana</hi>, power and authority, <pb id="pb20" n="20"/>to overcome and subdue all the foes that would surely rise up to oppose and defeat her. With wild gestures they signalled to Hiiaka once more to return.
</p><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s answering song, though pointed with blame, gives proof that her own intuitions were not entirely at fault:
</p><lg id="lg20.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A ka luna, i Pu&#8217;u-onioni,

But on this return of Hiiaka the whole family of brothers and sisters were so moved at the thought of the danger to Hiiaka that they spoke out at last and frankly advised Hiiaka to go before Pele and demand of her the gift of spiritual power, <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mana</hi>, that she might be able to meet her enemies on <pb id="pb21" n="21"/>equal terms at least, so that she need not feel powerless in their presence. But nothing came of this move at the time, for at this moment out came Pele from her cave, and, seeing Hiiaka standing with the others, she addressed her sharply and said: &#8220;What! You still here? Why are you not on the way to fetch our man?&#8221;
</p><p>Face to face with Pele, Hiiaka&#8217;s courage oozed away and she promised to make another start in the morning. When on this new start she had come near the top of the ascent, she turned about and sang:
</p><lg id="lg21.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Punohunohu i ka lani

    </l><l>Tranquil Wahine-kapu&#8217;s plain&#8212;
    </l><l>The Woman, why silent her voice?</l></lg><p>Hiiaka now made common cause with the group of sisters and relatives who were bent on securing for her justice and fair treatment. Among them, taking council together, sat Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai, Kapo and Pohakau<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a">This Pohakau was the friend, previously mentioned, who had brought to Pele the faithful dog that lay fasting and mourning at Lohiau&#8217;s grave. Pohakau remained at Pele&#8217;s court; the dog Pele hid away in her own secret place.</note>. By this action Hiiaka took a new attitude: while not coming out in open defiance to her sister, she virtually declared her determination no longer to be domineered over by Pele.
</p><p>In the council that took place it was determined that Ka-moho-alii, who stood high in Pele&#8217;s regards and whose authority was second only to hers, was the proper one to approach Pele in the matter of conferring upon Hiiaka the necessary mana. When, therefore, Pele put to Hiiaka the question why she had returned, why she was not on her journey, Ka-moho-alii spoke up and said, &#8220;It is because of fear she has returned. She sees danger by the way. You have not given her the mana to protect her from the <pb id="pb22" n="22"/>dragons and monsters that infest the road. <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">O Mo&#8217;o-lau ke ala, e</hi>: The way is beset by dragons four hundred.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Ah, that is the trouble?&#8221; said Pele. Then she called upon the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Wind, Rain, Thunder, Lightning&#8212;all the heavenly powers&#8212;to aid and safeguard Hiiaka and she authorized her to exercise the powers of these heavenly beings. The gods, thereupon, ratified this act of Pele; and at last the way was made clear for Hiiaka&#8217;s departure.



</p></div1><div1 id="ch7" n="VII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER VII</head><head>HIIAKA STARTS ON HER JOURNEY</head><p>The refusal of her sisters to undertake the mission to fetch Lohiau had angered Hiiaka. Her intrepid fealty to Pele, their oldest sister and their alii, laughed to scorn the perils of the journey. She could not and, for a time, would not bring herself to understand their prudential attitude. Pele was their alii, and it was rank disloyalty in them to shirk any danger or to decline any command Pele might think fit to impose. In judging the conduct of her sisters, it did not at first enter the head of Hiiaka that motives of sound worldly prudence justified them in declining for themselves an errand full of danger, or in putting obstacles in the way of her going on the same errand: she saw in it only a failure to rise to the level of her own loyalty.
</p><p>The situation, then, was heavily charged with estrangement, and when the woman in Hiiaka could not refrain from one more farewell, the color and tone of voice and song had in them the snap of electricity:

Go on your journey. Nothing shall avail to block your road. Yours is the power of woman; the power of man is nothing to that.&#8221;
</p><p>On reaching the plateau of Wahine-kapu Hiiaka received a spiritual message telling her that Lohiau&#8212;the object of her errand&#8212;was dead. She at once turned towards Pele and commemorated the fact in song:

</p><p>Hiiaka and her faithful companion&#8212;Pau-o-pala&#8217;e&#8212;had gotten well away from the vast pit of Kilauea, with its fringe of steam-cracks and fumaroles that radiate from it like the stays of a spider-web, and they were nearing the borders of Pana-ewa, when Hiiaka&#8217;s quick ear caught the sound of a squealing pig. Her ready intuition furnished the right interpretation to this seemingly insignificant occurrence:
</p><lg id="lg24.3" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A loko au o Pana-ewa,

    </l><l>Lehuas were heavy with bud,
    </l><l>The dim aisles solemn with shadow&#8212;
    </l><l>I met with a suckling pig,
    </l><l>The pet of Wahine-oma&#8217;o,
    </l><l>A wailing voice in the wilderness:
    </l><l>&#8217;Twas the creature wail of the thing,
    </l><l>Foredoomed as an offering, this
    </l><l>Wailing thing was a sacrifice,
    </l><l>An appeal to Pele for life,
    </l><l>To the Woman who dwells in the Pit.</l></lg><p>At this moment a young woman of attractive person appeared on the scene and, prostrating herself to the earth, said, &#8220;O, Pele, behold my offering, which I bring to thee in fulfillment of the pledge made by my parents, that I should first seek thee, O Pele, before I come to my marriage bed. Accept this suckling which I offer to thee, O Pele.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I am not the one you are seeking: I am not Pele,&#8221; said Hiiaka. &#8220;Pele is over yonder in the Pit.&#8221;
</p><p>The woman was persistent and begged that Hiiaka would not despise her offering. After undeceiving her, Hiiaka carefully instructed her, lest she make some fatal mistake in her approach to the jealous goddess: &#8220;When you come to the Pit you must be careful in your approach to Pele. The least departure from the etiquette she demands would be the cause of your death. Do not imagine that the fine large woman sitting at the door is Pele, nor that any one of the women seated within is she. You must pay no attention to these. Look for the figure of a wrinkled old woman lying bundled up on the hearth: that is Pele: make the offering to no one else but to her.&#8221;
<pb id="pb26" n="26"/></p><p>&#8220;Alas for me,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o. &#8220;You will be gone a long way from this place by the time I shall return to seek you. I shall not be able to find you.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;You will find us here,&#8221; replied Hiiaka assuringly.
</p><p>Hiiaka used her power to bring the woman at once to her destination. Following the instructions given her, Wahine-oma&#8217;o was quickly transported into the presence of Pele and, having made her offering in due form, was about to retire, when Pele called her back and said, &#8220;Did you not meet some women going from here as you came this way?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I met some women,&#8221; she answered.
</p><p>&#8220;Make haste and come up with them,&#8221; said Pele. &#8220;The younger woman is very dear to me. Attach yourself to her as a friend.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;That I will do,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o. Then, moved by an impulse that came to her (the work, it is said, of Hiiaka), she said to Pele, &#8220;I had imagined you to be a beautiful woman, Pele. But, lo, you are old and wrinkled; and your eyes are red and watery.&#8221; Thus saying, <corr sic="Wahine&#8217;oma&#8217;o">Wahine-oma&#8217;o</corr> took her departure and almost immediately found herself again with Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;You have made quick time,&#8221; Hiiaka said. &#8220;How did you get on?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I followed your instructions and presented my offering to the woman who was lying on the hearth. She asked me if I had met you, and when I said yes, she told me to look after you as a friend.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;She also told me to watch you, to observe how you behaved towards the man&#8212;whether you kissed him or had any dalliance with him.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;And did you say anything to Pele?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;U-m, I bantered her about her looks; told her she was a very ill-favored woman, while the women attending her were very handsome.&#8221;
</p><p rend="indent(4em)">Hiiaka laughed at this naive account.
</p><p>Night shut down upon them at Kuolo, a place just on the border of Pana-ewa. Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e proposed that they should seek a resting place for the night with the people of the hamlet. Hiiaka would not hear to it: &#8220;Travelers should sleep in the open, in the road; in that way they can rise and resume their journey with no delay.&#8221; (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">O ka po&#8217;e hele he pono ia lakou e moe i ke alanui, i ala no a hele no.</hi>)

Their way led through lehua groves of the most luxuriant growth, the bloom of which crimsons the landscape to this day, exuding a honey that is most attractive to the birds of heaven. The cool still air wafted to their ears the hum of voices which was soon explained when they came upon a bevy of girls who were busily plucking the bright flowers to string into wreaths and garlands, in anticipation of some entertainment. This rural scene made an appeal to the poet in Hiiaka which she could not resist:
</p><lg id="lg27.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A Wai-akea, i ka Hilo-hana-kahi,
    </l><l>Ala i ka wa po iki,
    </l><l>I ka lehua lei o Hilo, o Hi-lo;

</p><lg id="lg27.2" type="Group"><l>At Wai-akea, in Hilo&#8212;
    </l><l>The Hilo of Hana-kahi&#8212;
    </l><l>They rise in the early morning
    </l><l>To weave fresh wreaths of lehua,
    </l><l>Inbeading its bloom with hala&#8212;
    </l><l>Gay Hilo of Hana-kahi!</l></lg><p>At sight of Hiiaka&#8217;s party, the lively flower-girls made a rush, as if to capture and appropriate their friendly acquaintance for individual possession. The most vivacious and forward of the whole party was Pa-pulehu, their leader, a buxom young woman, of good family, who at once took possession of Hiiaka for herself, crowned and bedecked her with wreaths and garlands, with many expressions of enthusiastic admiration: &#8220;This is <hi>my</hi> friend!&#8212;What a beauty!&#8212;How the scarlet lehua becomes her!&#8212;Just look, girls!&#8212;And now you are to come and be my guest.&#8212;The feast is set for this very day.&#8212;But you are all welcome.&#8221;
</p><p>The unrestrained gush of the young woman&#8217;s rattling talk was quite in contrast to the selected words of Hiiaka.
<pb id="pb28" n="28"/></p><p>Now Pa-pulehu was of a large and important family, embracing numerous friends and relations, and, having ample means, her hospitalities were unstinted. The report spread quickly, &#8220;Pa-pulehu has a distinguished guest come to visit her. There is to be a feast this afternoon. All are invited.&#8221;
</p><p>The tables were spread with a great variety of fish, meats, fruits and vegetables. The parents and guardians of the girl, nevertheless, came to her and inquired, &#8220;What is there that this young woman, your friend, would specially like to eat?&#8221; Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e took it upon her to answer, that the one thing that would be most acceptable to Hiiaka would be a dish of luau. Thereupon a large quantity of young and delicate taro leaves were prepared for the table.
</p><p>When they were gathered at the tables, Hiiaka sitting in the place of honor, Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e, at her request, bade all the people incline their heads and close their eyes. Then Hiiaka called upon her allies, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the elements and all the gods to come to the feast and partake; and when the prayer was ended and they opened their eyes&#8212;lo, the tables spread for Hiiaka were empty! Hiiaka had not been seen to take into her hands any of the food that was spread before her. It had vanished away as a drop of water evaporates in the heat of the sun.
</p><p>The feast being concluded, Hiiaka rose, bade good bye to the people and resumed her journey, taking with her Pa-pulehu.
</p><p>This girl Pa-pulehu was of genuine flesh and blood, with no blend of divine ichor in her veins, such as enriched the blood of Hiiaka; nor had she, like Wahine-oma&#8217;o and Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e, been strengthened and made more resistant to spiritual and physical foes&#8212;a privilege granted to those who had enjoyed a close approach to Pele as attendants and worshippers. This weakness in her nature had its influence in determining the fate to which her history now quickly leads.
</p><p>Their journey still lay through Puna. They were at Kalalau, not far from Haena (at the place where, centuries afterwards, Kamehameha was struck with that well-nigh fatal blow by an outraged fisherman). Some fishermen were hauling in their nets full of fish. The sight was too much for Pa-pulehu. &#8220;I hunger for fish,&#8221; she <corr sic="xeclaimed">exclaimed</corr>. &#8220;These fish belong to my father. Oh, if I only were at home! how I would eat until I was satisfied!&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka thought it best to indulge the appetite of this novice in <pb id="pb29" n="29"/>her service. From a little knoll overlooking the ocean, she descried the canoe of a fisherman named Pahulu floating in the offing, but already well stocked with fish. Hiiaka used her power and drove away the school of fish that would have come to his net. The man himself was so intent on his work that he had no eyes for what was passing on shore; but his assistant exclaimed, &#8220;Look at the beautiful woman standing on the shore and watching us!&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I must keep my eyes on my nets,&#8221; the fisherman replied.
</p><p>Thereupon Hiiaka attracted his attention with a song:
</p><lg id="lg29.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Nani ku a ka Hilo pali-ku!
    </l><l>O ka au-hula ana o Ka-lalau,
    </l><l>O ka au alana loa i kai, e!

</p><lg id="lg29.2" type="Group"><l>A standing wonder, Hilo cliffs!
    </l><l>How daring this Ka-lalau swimming,
    </l><l>Far out to sea on a floating plank!
    </l><l>Pray grant us, O man, of your fish&#8212;
    </l><l>Fish for the herb-swollen rustic.</l></lg><p>This brought the two fishermen ashore who thereupon willingly parted with some of their fish to Hiiaka, coupling the gift, however, with a proposition insulting to the honor of the two women. The fishermen, imagining they had the two women under their power, were soon after seen lying in the open embracing two figures of stone which they, in their insane infatuation, fancied were the two women, thus exposing themselves to the jeers and derision of their fellows.
</p><p>Pa-pulehu cooked and ate the fish, but her manner of eating was lacking in due punctilio, in that she did not dispose properly of the unconsumed parts&#8212;the tails, fins, bones and scales&#8212;of the fish. She should have burned or buried them; instead she left them lying about in a slovenly way. This neglect was highly offensive to Pele and caused her to withdraw from Pa-pulehu the protection she otherwise would have given her.

Hiiaka had deigned to appeal to the girl Pa-pulehu, she being a kamaaina<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Kamaaina</hi>, a resident, one acquainted with the land.</note>, as if for information. When Hiiaka announced her determination to take the short road, the one of danger that struck through the heart of Pana-ewa, Pa-pulehu drew back in dismay and expostulated: &#8220;That is not a fit road for us, or for any but a band of warriors. If we go that way we shall be killed.&#8221; She broke forth with lamentations, bewailing her coming fate and the desolation that was about to visit her family.
</p><p>As they advanced Wahine-oma&#8217;o descried a gray scare-crow object motionless in the road ahead of them. She thought it to be the blasted stump of a kukui tree. Hiiaka recognized its true character, the witch-form taken as a disguise by a mo&#8217;o. It was a scout sent out by Pana-ewa; in real character a hag, but slimed with a gray excrement to give it closer resemblance to a mouldering tree-stump. The deceiving art of magic did not avail against Hiiaka. She rushed forward to give the death stroke to the foul thing, which at once groveled in the dirt in its true form.
</p><p>Night overtook them in a dense forest. While the others lay and slept, Hiiaka reconnoitered the situation. The repose of the wilderness was unbroken save for the restless flitting of a solitary bird that peered at Hiiaka obtrusively. It was a spy in the employ of Pana-ewa and its actions roused the lively suspicions of Hiiaka, eliciting from her an appropriate incantation:

Having done their work, the two scouts waked the drowsy monster in the middle of the night with the information that four human beings, women, had entered his domain and were coming towards him. &#8220;Where are they?&#8221; he asked.
</p><p>&#8220;Out in this direction (pointing), and they are moving this way.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Well, this day of fasting has gone by. What a pity, however, that the poi in my calabash has turned sour, but the taro is sweet. Eye-balls! what juicy, delicious morsels! The day of privation turns out to be a day of feasting.&#8221; Thus muttered the cannibal monster, gloating like Polyphemus in his cave at the prospect of a feast.
</p><p>Hiiaka kept her own courage at the fine point of seeming indifference, she also inspired her companions with the same feeling by the calm confidence displayed in her singing:

Tooth and claw ran amuck. Flesh was torn, limbs rent apart, blood ran like water. If it had been only a battle with enemies in the open Hiiaka would have made short work of the job. Her foes lay ambushed in every wood and brake and assumed every imaginable disguise. A withered bush, a bunch of grass, a moss-grown stone, any, the most innocent object in nature, might prove to be an assailant ready to spit venom or tear with hook and talon. Hiiaka had need of every grain of wit and every spark of courage in her nature. Nothing could withstand her onset and the billows of attack against her person were broken as by a solid rock. Some described her as wielding a flaming battle-ax and hurling missiles of burning sulphur. They might well be deceived. The quickness of her every motion was a counterfeit of the riving blade or blazing fire-ball. Some assert that, in her frenzy, she tore with her teeth and even devoured the reeking flesh until her stomach rose in rebellion. Such a notion seems incompatible with the violence of her disgust for the reptilian blood that besmeared her from sole to crown.
</p><p>Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e, using her magical pa&#250; as a besom of destruction, was transformed into a veritable Bellona; and Wahine-oma&#8217;o displayed the courage of an amazon. These both escaped serious injury. The unhappy fate of Pa-pulehu realized that girl&#8217;s premonition. She fell into the hands of the enemy and, as if to fulfill the prediction of Pele, became &#8220;food for the gods of Pana-ewa.&#8221;
</p><p>As Hiiaka glanced heavenward, she saw the zenith filled with cloud-forms&#8212;Kane, Kanaloa, <corr sic="Ka-moho alii">Ka-moho-alii</corr>, Poha-kau and <pb id="pb36" n="36"/>others, encouraging her with their looks. The sight, while it cheered, wrung from her a fervent prayer:

</p></div1><div1 id="ch10" n="X" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER X</head><head>HIIAKA&#8217;S BATTLE WITH <corr sic="PANAEWA">PANA-EWA</corr></head><p>The bird-spies sent out by Pana-ewa brought back contradictory reports. The first pair reported that Hiiaka was being worsted. Soon after another pair, garbling the facts, said &#8220;Our people are lying down, but they are still alert and keep their eyes open. As for Hiiaka, she has fallen into a deep sleep.&#8221;
</p><p>The situation was far from satisfactory and Pana-ewa despatched another pair of birds to reconnoitre and report. It was not yet morning and the night was dark; and they accordingly took the form of kukui<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Kukui</hi>, the tree whose nuts furnished torches.</note> trees, thinking thus to illuminate the scene of operations. The intelligence they brought was confounding: &#8220;Our people,&#8221; they said, &#8220;are all dead, save those who have the form of kukui trees. Hiiaka lies quietly sleeping in the road.&#8221;
</p><p>This account, though strictly in accord with the facts, was so disconcerting to Pana-ewa that he burst forth in a rage, &#8220;Slaves, liars! you&#8217;re deceiving me. I&#8217;ll wring your necks!&#8221; and he reached out to execute his threat. The birds eluded him and found safety in flight.
<pb id="pb37" n="37"/></p><p>Pana-ewa now saw that it was necessary to take the field in person at the head of his regular forces, composed of the Nam&#250; and Naw&#225;. The disguise he chose for himself was that of an ohia-lehua tree. No sooner had he taken that form than he found himself unable to move hand or foot. A parasitic network of i-e-i-e embraced his body and a multitude of a&#235;rial roots anchored him to the spot. It was the craft of the sleeping girl that had done this. He had to content himself with the unwarlike guise of the kukui tree.
</p><p>While Hiiaka slept, her faithful servitor Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e kept open eye and detective ear to what was going on in the star-lit forest about them. At the first glimmering of dawn her keen sense felt rather than heard a murmurous rustle that broke the stillness and a movement, as if the forest itself were advancing and closing in upon them. This oncoming of the enemy was in such contrast to the onset of the yelping pack on the previous day as to be most impressive. The sound that touched her keen sense was not the joyous twitter and stir of nature preparing to greet a new day; it was rather the distant mutter of the storm, soon to be heard as the growl of the tempest, or the roar and snarl of an enraged menagerie of wild beasts.
</p><p>The woman felt her responsibility and, with the double intent of summoning to their aid the friendly gods and of waking Hiiaka, she lifted a solemn prayer:

Then Ku-ili-kaua, a man of war and a leader in battle, spoke up and, addressing Ka-moho-alii, said &#8220;Why is it that she does not send warriors to the assistance of her sister?

Heaven and earth stirred at their onset. The visible signs of their array were manifest in columns of seething fire-shot clouds that hovered like vultures over the advancing army. Arrived at striking distance, they let loose their lightning-bolts and sounded their thunder-gongs. Earth <pb id="pb45" n="45"/>and heaven at once became turmoiled in one confused whirl of warring elements.
</p><p>The warriors of Pana-ewa, who&#8212;in imitation of their chief&#8212;had for the most part taken the guise of trees and other natural objects, found themselves from the first fettered and embarrassed by a tangle of parasitic vines, so that their thrusts against Hiiaka were of little avail. Now comes the onset of the Pele gods in the tempest-forms of hurricane, lightning, hail, and watery cloud-bursts that opened heaven&#8217;s flood-gates. Against these elemental forces the dryad-forms of Pana-ewa&#8217;s host could not stand for a moment. Their tree-shapes were riven and torn limb from limb, engulfed in a swirling tide that swept them down to the ocean and far out to sea.
</p><p>Two staunch fighters remained, Kiha, who had chosen to retain the honest dragon-form; and Pua&#8217;a-loa, a creature, like Kama-pua&#8217;a, in the demi-shape of a boar, whom Pana-ewa, at the scent of disaster, had thrust into the confinement of a secret cave. This manner of retreat saved the twain from the immediate disaster by flood but not from the vengeance of Pele&#8217;s army. Detected in their lairs, they were slain and their petrified bodies are pointed out to this day in verification of this story.
</p><p>The fate of Pana-ewa himself was most tragical. He no sooner had taken the form of a kukui tree than he found himself overlaid and entangled with meshes of parasitic growth; he could neither fight nor fly. The spot on which he stood sank and became a swamp, a lake, a sink; the foundations on which its bottom rested were broken up and fell away. Pana-ewa, swallowed up in the gulf, was swept out to sea and perished in the waves. Kane-lu-honua had broken up the underlying strata and made of the place a bottomless sink.
</p><p>(A reef is pointed out in the ocean opposite Papa&#8217;i which is the remains of the body of the mo&#8217;o Pana-ewa.)
</p><p>The part taken by Hiiaka in this last act of her deliverance was hardly more than that of a spectator. She had but to look on and witness the accomplishment of her own salvation. Having been <corr sic="rousedfrom">roused from</corr> the refreshment of sleep by the long-drawn recitative of Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e&#8217;s prayer-mele (see pp. <ref target="pb37">37</ref>&#8211;<ref target="pb40">40</ref>), she did her best to cheer her two companions with assurances of coming deliverance and, gathering her little brood about her, after the <pb id="pb46" n="46"/>manner of a mother-hen, figuratively, bade them cling to her, nestle under her wings, lest they should be swept away in the flood of waters that soon began to surge about them&#8212;a flood which carried far out to sea the debris of battle&#8212;as already described.
</p><p>The victory for Hiiaka was complete. Hawaii for once, and for all time, was rid of that pestilential, man-eating, mo&#8217;o band headed by Pana-ewa who, from the time of Pele&#8217;s coming, had remained entrenched in the beautiful forest-land that still bears the name&#8212;Pana-ewa.



</p></div1><div1 id="ch11" n="XI" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XI</head><head>HIIAKA HAS VARIOUS ADVENTURES&#8212;THE SHARK MAKAU-KIU</head><p>At one stroke, the benign action of the heavenly powers had freed a fair land from a pestilential mo&#8217;o band, disinfected it of the last shred and fragment of their carcases and ushered in a reign of peace in the wooded parks and tangled forests of <corr sic="Pan-ewa">Pana-ewa</corr>. Hiiaka could afford to celebrate her victory by recuperating her powers in well-earned repose. While she thus lay in profound sleep on the purified battle-field, her two companions busied themselves in preparing such simple refreshment as the wilderness afforded. The <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piece de resistance</hi> of this dinner of herbs was luau, the favorite food of the Pele family.
</p><p>When the women had finished the task of collecting, sorting, making into bundles and cooking the delicate leaves of kalo, Hiiaka still slept. Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e thereupon took her station at the feet of her mistress and chanted the dinner-call in the form of a gentle serenade:
</p><lg id="lg46.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>E ala, e ala, e!

</p><lg id="lg47.1" type="Group"><l>O Daughter of heaven,
    </l><l>Awake, awake!
    </l><l>Hiiaka, awake!
    </l><l>Sender of winter rain,
    </l><l>Guardian of womanly rites,
    </l><l>Spouse of God Maka-li&#8217;i,
    </l><l>Awake thee, awake!</l></lg><p>&#8220;The luau must be burnt to a crisp,&#8221; Hiiaka said as she sat up.
</p><p>As Hiiaka and her companions again wended their way through the forest, it was evident that its innocent creatures had unjustly suffered in company with their guilty invaders and time had not yet sufficed for the exercise of that miracle of tropic repair which quickly heals and covers the damage done by a tempest. Broken limbs, fallen trees and twisted vines still blocked the narrow trails, while here and there an uprooted forest giant, in unseemly fashion, obtruded a Medusa-head of tawny roots in place of its comely coronal of leaves.
</p><p>In their journey they came at length to a place, Maka&#8217;u-kiu, where the road seemingly ended abruptly in a precipice with the ocean dashing wildly at its base. The alternative open to their choice was, to seek out some round-about inland way, or to take the shorter route and swim the ocean-made gap. The two women, Wahine-oma&#8217;o taking the lead, proposed, as a diversion, to swim the ocean and thus avoid a long and wearisome detour. Hiiaka strenuously vetoed the proposition; but the two women, not yet trained to subordinate their will and judgment to the decision of the leader, persisted. Hiiaka, thereupon, took a stem of the ti plant and, peeling off its rusty bark, left it white and easily visible. &#8220;I will throw this stick into the water,&#8221; said she, &#8220;and if it disappears we will not make of this an <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">au-hula-ana</hi>;<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Au-hula-ana.</hi> This is the term applied to such a break in a seaside trail as is above described. The word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">hula</hi> indicates the billowy toss of the ocean or of the swimmer&#8217;s body while making the passage. The term, following Hawaiian usage, is employed either as a noun or as a verb.</note> but if it remains in sight, then we will swim across this wild piece of water.&#8221;
</p><p>It seemed to Hiiaka that her companions displayed a masculine stubbornness and unreasonableness, a criticism which she uttered in her chanting way:

<pb id="pb48" n="48"/>

    </l><l>Be you two stubborn as men!
    </l><l>Let me be guideful as woman.</l></lg><p>Hiiaka then threw the peeled stick into the ocean and in a moment it was snatched out of sight. &#8220;There! If we were to swim we would be seized and eaten by Maka&#8217;u-kiu.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;When you tossed the stick into the ocean, the sea-moss covered and concealed it, and you thought it was the work of a shark,&#8221; was the reply of Wahine-oma&#8217;o. Again they made ready to plunge into the sea. Hiiaka threw another stick and that too was instantly swallowed; whereupon she chanted again:

    </l><l>Ko lalo o Kaka-auki,

    </l><l>That is my service to you!</l></lg><p>At these words the huge form of the shark rose to the surface, and the women, convinced at last, leaped out of the water and abandoned their purpose. Hiiaka now gave battle to the shark and that was the end of one more power of evil.

These valleys take head in a wild forest region, the home of mist, rain and swamp. Adjoining this and part of the same watershed is the region known as Mahiki-waena, a land which the convenience of traffic required should be open to travel. It was the haunt of a ferocious horde of mo&#8217;o called mahiki<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ma-hi-ki</hi> (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mahiti</hi>, <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mawhiti</hi>), to leap, to skip, to spring up suddenly<corr>.</corr> The Maori Comp. Dict. E. Tregear.</note> from their power to leap and spring like grass-hoppers.
</p><p>When Hiiaka proposed to pass through this region in the <pb id="pb50" n="50"/>ordinary course of travel, the head of the Mahiki insolently denied her the right of way, suggesting as an alternative the boisterous sea-route around the northern shoulder of Hawaii. Hiiaka&#8217;s blood was up. The victory over the hosts of Pana-ewa and the more recent destruction of Maka&#8217;u-kiu had fired her courage. She resolved once for all to make an end of this arrogant nuisance and to rid the island of the whole pestilential brood of imps and mo&#8217;o. Standing on a height that overlooked Wai-pi&#8217;o, she chanted a mele which is at once descriptive of the scene before her and at the same time expressive of her determination:
</p><p lang="haw" xml:lang="haw"><hi rend="sc">Mele Uhau</hi>

An agonizing cry of distress assailed her ear. It came from a dismantled heap of human flesh, the remains of two men who had been most brutally handled&#8212;by these same Mahiki, perhaps&#8212;their leg and arm-bones plucked out and they left <pb id="pb51" n="51"/>to welter in their misery. It was seemingly the cruel infliction of the Mahiki. The cry of the two wretches could not be disregarded:

She left them seated in comfort at the roadside at Polol&#250;.
</p><p>The Mahiki, on seeing Hiiaka advance into their territory, threw up the dirt and dust in their front, to express their contempt for such an <corr sic="insiginficant">insignificant</corr> body of trespassers. Hiiaka, paying no attention to their insolence, pressed on. Her purpose was to strike directly at Mo&#8217;o-lau, the leader of the horde, to whom she addressed this incantation:

Hiiaka at once flew at her and put an end to her.
</p><p>Now began a fierce battle between Hiiaka and the Mahiki dragon and his forces. They fought till both sides were exhausted and then, as if by mutual consent, stopped to rest.
</p><p>Hiiaka perceived that the battle was to be even more fiercely contested than that at Pana-ewa. She bade Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e to take good care that no ill came to Wahine-oma&#8217;o. Looking up into the heavens, Hiiaka saw her relatives and friends Poha-kau, Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai, and a large concourse of other gods, including Kane, Kanaloa, Ku and Lono, watching her, evidently greatly interested in her performances. They assured her of their protection. At this Hiiaka was much encouraged and gave utterance to her feelings in this kanaenae:

His attack was direct, but he divided his host into two columns so as to envelope Hiiaka and attack her on each flank. Hiiaka saw them approaching through the jungle and chanted the following rallying song:

</p><p>When the battalion of gods moved against the mo&#8217;o, it was a rout and a slaughter. Then the cry arose: &#8220;No fight has been made against the Mahiki dragon; he yet survives.&#8221; Thereupon <pb id="pb54" n="54"/>they turned their attack against that old dragon and his guards. Hiiaka then celebrated the double victory in this paean:

With this as a besom she beat them down as a husbandman might beat down a swarm of locusts. The Mahiki and the Mo&#8217;o-lau had ceased to exist as organized bodies. But from the rout and slaughter of the armies many individuals had escaped with their lives, and these had hid themselves away in caves and secret places, some of them even, presuming apparently upon their power of disguise, had taken refuge in the remote scattered habitations of the people. Such an inference seems to be justified by the language of the mele now to be given:
<milestone rend="line" unit="tb"/>
</p><p id="note54" rend="font-size(smaller)"><hi rend="sc">Note.</hi>&#8212;The gods that came to the assistance of Hiiaka such times as circumstances pinched her and whose spiritual power at all times re&#235;nforced her feeble humanity were limited in their dominion to certain vaguely defined provinces and departments. Thus, if there was any sea-fighting to be done, it fell to the shark-god, the Admiral Ka-moho-alii, to take charge of it. On the other hand, the conduct of a battle on <hi>terra firma</hi> would be under the generalship of Kane-milo-hai; while to Kana-loa belonged the marshalling of the celestial hosts, the moon and the stars. But the orb of day, the Sun, belonged to Lono. Hence, if the fighting was during the hours of daylight, Lono would logically assume the command. The rule of the great god Ku was also exercised principally by day. It was he who arranged the calendar and settled the order of the seasons, the days and the nights. The subdivisions and departmental complications under these general divisions were numerous.

Like a wise general, she would leave no enemies in her rear.
</p><p>When they came into the neighborhood of Wahine-oma&#8217;o&#8217;s home, that girl spoke up and said, &#8220;I think we had better take another road. If we keep to this one, which passes by my door, my parents, who will be watching for me, will see me and will want me to remain with them.&#8221; This she said by reason of her great desire to continue in Hiiaka&#8217;s company.

</p><lg id="lg56.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>E Puna-hoa i Kai-pala-oa,
    </l><l>I na maka o Nana-kilo ma
    </l><l>E nonoho mai la, e.
    </l><l>Auhea ka ala, e?</l></lg><p rend="class(transh)">TRANSLATION
</p><lg id="lg56.2" type="Group"><l>O Puna-hoa and <corr sic="Kai-pala-o&#228;">Kai-pala-oa</corr>,
    </l><l>You with the clear-scanning eyes,
    </l><l>Sitting at rest before me,
    </l><l>Point me out now the road.</l></lg><p>&#8220;The road is plain enough; you are taking the right way.... We are looking at that young woman of your party&#8212;she has such a strong resemblance to our missing daughter, save her way of shuffling and holding her head.&#8221;
</p><p>On reaching the outskirts of the village of Hilo, Hiiaka found a rickety foot-bridge, consisting of a single narrow and wobbly plank, liable to turn at every step and precipitate the passenger into the tumbling waters below&#8212;and this was the only passage across the rocky chasm of the Wai-luku<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Wai-luku</hi>, water of destruction.</note> river. This precarious crossing was the work of two sorcerers, degenerate nondescripts, who had the audacity to levy toll for the use of their bridge, in default of which the traveler suddenly found himself precipitated into the raging water. By virtue of their necromantic powers, they had the presumption to claim spiritual kinship with Hiiaka, a bond the woman could not absolutely repudiate.
</p><p>&#8220;Here comes our mo&#8217;o-puna,<corr>&#8221;</corr><note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Mo&#8217;o-puna</hi>, a grandchild, nephew or niece.</note> called out Pili-a-mo&#8217;o to his companion.
</p><p>&#8220;Well, what of it? She will have to pay her fare the same as anyone else,&#8221; replied Noho-a-mo&#8217;o. &#8220;Only on that condition shall she cross by our bridge.&#8221;
</p><p>On Hiiaka&#8217;s attempting to cross without paying toll, the two <pb id="pb57" n="57"/>sorcerers would, following their own practice, have disarranged the treacherous plank and precipitated her and her party into the raging stream.
</p><p>&#8220;Well said,&#8221; Noho-a-mo&#8217;o replied; &#8220;provided she will consent to it.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka now called to them in the language of song:

A secondary meaning, much employed in the argot of hula folk, is to hand over, to pass this way; as when one guest at table might say to a neighbor, &#8220;hand me the salt (if you please).&#8221;</note> e-e,

</p><p>Hiiaka replied by repeating her request in nearly the same words:

Not even when Hiiaka, as if to cap the climax of their absurdity, ended her demand with this ironical request:
</p><lg id="lg58.2" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Ho-mai, ho&#8217;i, ka wai, e;

If I attack them, they will run for their lives.&#8221;
</p><p>The people, failing to recognize Hiiaka as their deliverer, spiritless from long habituation to the fraudulent dominion of these imposters, fearful also of their vengeance, stoutly opposed Hiiaka, affirming that Pili-a-mo&#8217;o and Noho-a-mo&#8217;o were gods in reality, having great power and capable of doing many wonderful things. They declared their readiness to back their opinion with their property, yes, with their lives. They were at length persuaded, however, to accept as decisive the test proposed by Hiiaka, namely, that, if they fled when attacked, they should cease to be regarded as gods and should be dealt with as imposters.
<pb id="pb59" n="59"/></p><p>True to Hiiaka&#8217;s prediction, the mo&#8217;o, in abject fear, turned and fled for their lives at her first threatening move and she now called upon the people to pursue and destroy them:

</p><p>As the creatures fled from Hiiaka&#8217;s pursuit, their human disguise fell from them and their real character as mo&#8217;o was evident.
</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve committed a great blunder,&#8221; said Pili-a-mo&#8217;o to his mate. &#8220;It looks as if she meant to kill us. Let us apologize for our mistake and conciliate her with fair words.&#8221;
</p><p>Noho-a-mo&#8217;o agreed to this and, turning to Hiiaka, made this wheedling speech:

Thus did Hiiaka add one more to the score of her victories in the extermination of the mo&#8217;o.



</p></div1><div1 id="ch14" n="XIV" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XIV</head><head>HIIAKA MEETS MOTHER-GRUNDY</head><p>It was at this point of the journey that Hiiaka lost the attendance of her sympathetic companion and faithful servant, Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e. She was persuaded to unite her fortunes with those of a man from Kohala named Pa-ki&#8217;i; and we must leave unanswered the question, how she finally settled with Pele this apparent desertion of the trust with which she had been charged, that of acting as aide, kahu, to Hiiaka. Wahine-oma&#8217;o now remains as the sole companion of Hiiaka in her future adventures.
</p><p>On resuming the journey they came before long to the broad stream of <corr sic="Honolii">Honoli&#8217;i</corr>, which was swimming deep and, in the lack of other means of crossing, they bundled their clothes, held them above their heads with one hand and easily made the opposite shore by swimming with the aid of the other hand.
</p><p>At the sight of this performance, the ghost-god, Hina-hina-ku-i-ka-pali and her companion, in a spirit of pure fault-finding and Mother-Grundyism, exclaimed:
<pb id="pb61" n="61"/>

</p><lg id="lg61.2" type="Group"><l>The women bundle their garments
    </l><l>And, naked, they swim the stream,

    </l><l>&#8217;Tis a slur on your noble rank,
    </l><l>I too am a chief, my name
    </l><l>Hina-hina-gem-of-the-cliff.</l></lg><p>&#8220;For shame!&#8221; said Hiiaka. &#8220;These ghost-gods have been spying on our nakedness, and now they make sport of us.&#8221;
</p><p>A great fear came upon the ghosts, that the dread goddess would seize them and pinch out their atomy spark of existence. In their terror, they flew home and, perched on the shoulders of their mother, besought her to interpose in their behalf and appease Hiiaka by a suitable offering of luau.
</p><p>&#8220;There burns a fire,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o, as they drew near the house.
</p><p>&#8220;The fire of the ovens built by the ghosts,&#8221; Hiiaka answered. &#8220;They have saved themselves from death.&#8221;
</p><p>By the time they reached the house the luau was done to a turn and the tables were spread. Wahine-oma&#8217;o made an oblation to the gods and then ate of the viands. Hiiaka did not partake of the food.
</p><p>Hiiaka now spent several days at Hono-kane, in Kohala, anxiously awaiting the departure of some canoe, by which she might pass over to the island of Maui. While thus absorbed, in a sentimental mood, looking one day across the ocean at the misty outline of the distant land, she saw a man of remarkable appearance strike out from one headland of the bay to swim to the opposite point. Her admiration for his physical beauty and his daring performance drew from her a song:
</p><lg id="lg61.3" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>I i au, e au ma kai o ka hula ana.

</p><p>As they sat at a feast spread in her honor, Hiiaka, as was her wont, bowed her head in prayer with closed eyes, and the others did likewise and when they opened their eyes and looked, the portion that had been set before Hiiaka was gone, spirited away.
</p><p>In the evening it was announced that a canoe was to sail in the early morning on a voyage to Maui, whereupon Hiiaka secured the promise of a passage for herself and Wahine-oma&#8217;o.



<pb id="pb63" n="63"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch15" n="XV" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XV</head><head>THE VOYAGE TO MAUI</head><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s voyage across the Ale-nui-haha channel, considered merely as a sea adventure, was a tame experience. There was no storm, no boistrous weather, sea as calm as a mill-pond, nothing to fillip the imagination with a sense of excitement or danger; yet it was far from being an agreeable experience to the young woman who was now having her first hand-to-hand tussle with the world.
</p><p>They had spent the night at the house of one Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui. In the early morning their host and a younger man&#8212;apparently his son&#8212;named Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-iki, made ready their canoe to sail for Maui. Hiiaka, assuming that passage would be granted both of them, in accordance with a promise made the previous day, stood ready against the hour of departure. At the last moment, the younger man, having assisted Wahine-oma&#8217;o to her seat in the bow next to himself, called to his elder, &#8220;Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui, why don&#8217;t you show your passenger to her seat, the one next you?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui answered groutily. &#8220;I find that the canoe will be overloaded if we take passengers aboard and all our landlord&#8217;s freight will get wet.&#8221;
</p><p>The real reason for this <hi>volte-face</hi> on the part of the old sailor was that he had made an unseemly proposition to Hiiaka the night before and she had repelled him.
</p><p>Wahine-oma&#8217;o, thereupon, left her seat and the canoe started without them. It was not more than fairly underway, however, when a violent sea struck the craft and swamped it, and all the loose freight was floating about in the ocean.
</p><p>&#8220;There, you see! We&#8217;d &#8217;ave had better luck with the women aboard.&#8221; Such was the exclamation of Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-iki.
</p><p>It did not take long to convince the old man Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui, who was captain of the canoe, that he had invited this disaster on himself, the agent of which, as he rightly suspected, was none other than the distinguished-looking young woman who now stood on the beach watching him in his predicament with unperturbed countenance.
</p><p>The two men floated their canoe, collected their baggage and came ashore. When they had got the stuff dry and stowed in the waist of the craft, they escorted the women aboard, seating Wahine-oma&#8217;o, as directed by the captain, in the bow near Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-iki <pb id="pb64" n="64"/>and Hiiaka in the after part, within arm&#8217;s length of Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui, and they put to sea.
</p><p>The canoe was a small affair, unprovided with that central platform, the pola, that might serve as the cabin or quarter deck, on which the passengers could stretch themselves for comfort. In her weariness, Hiiaka, with her head toward the bow, reclined her body against the top rail of the canoe, thus eking out the insufficiency of the narrow thwart that was her seat; and she fell asleep, or rather, entered that border-land of Nod, in which the central watchman has not yet given over control of the muscular system and the ear still maintains its aerial reconnoissance.
</p><p>The wind, meanwhile, as it caromed aft from the triangular sail of mat, coquetted with her tropical apparel and made pa&#250; and kihei shake like summer leaves.
</p><p>The steersman, in whom that precious factor, a chivalrous regard for woman, was even of less value than is common to the savage breast, in the pursuit of a fixed purpose, began to direct amorous glances at the prostrate form before him and to the neglect of his own proper duties. Presently he left his steering and stole up to Hiiaka with privy paw outstretched. Hiiaka roused from her half-dreamy state on the instant, and the man sprang back and resumed his paddle.
</p><p>Hiiaka, with the utmost coolness, expressed in song her remonstrance and sarcastic rebuke for this exhibition of inhospitable rudeness:
</p><lg id="lg64.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A Hono-ma-ele au, i Hono-ka-lani,

</p><p>In the midst of this unpleasantness it was a comfort to hear the strong cheerful voice of her former companion Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e calling to her across the stretch of waters. It will be remembered that their roads had parted company sometime before Hiiaka had left the big island. The separation had made no change, however, in their mutual affection:

But they were nowhere to be found. They had disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed them up. When Pi&#8217;i-ke-a-nui asked the people of the village as to the whereabouts of the two young women who had just now landed as passengers from the canoe, they one and all denied having set eyes upon them.
</p><p>Hiiaka had planned a visit with her sister Kapo; but, on reaching Wailuku, the house was empty; Kapo and her husband Pua-nui had but just started to make a ceremonious call on Ole-pau, a famous chief of the district. The receding figure of Kapo was already hazy in the distance, so that it seemed more than doubtful if the words of Hiiaka&#8217;s message reached the ears for which they were intended:
</p><lg id="lg67.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>He ahui hala<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Hala.</hi> The fruit of the hala was so often worn in the form of a wreath by Kapo that it came to be looked upon almost as her emblem. To ordinary mortals this practice savored of bad luck. If a fisherman traveling on his way to the ocean were to meet a person wearing a lei of this description he would feel compelled to turn back and give over his excursion for that day. In this instance Kapo was on her way to visit a sick man&#8212;a bad omen for him.</note> ko Kapo-ula-kina&#8217;u,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Kapo-ula-kina&#8217;u.</hi> This was the full name of Kapo, who was one of the goddesses of the kahunas who practiced anaana (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">po&#8217;e kahuna anaana</hi>). <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ula-kina&#8217;u</hi> is a term applied to a feather cloak or cape made of yellow feathers which had in them black spots.</note>

Yet, in spite of her maimed condition, the brave spirit busied herself gathering shell-fish; and when a tumbling wave rolled across the beach she made herself a partner in its sport and gleefully retreated, skipping and dancing to the words of a song:

    </l><l>Oh Kona, thou land of peace and of calm!</l></lg><p>Search for the hidden meaning of this oli has brought out a marvellous diversity of opinion. The chief difficulty lies in the interpretation of the second verse: <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ka i&#8217;a kahiko pu no me ka wahine</hi>, and centers in the expression <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kahiko pu</hi>. One able critic finds in it an allusion to the co&#246;peration of women with the men in the work of fishing. <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Kahiko</hi> is a word of dignity meaning finely apparelled. The addition of the preposition <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pu</hi> amplifies it and gives it almost the meaning of wrapped together. It seems probable also that the word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">i&#8217;a</hi>, literally fish, is to be taken in an esoteric sense as a euphemism for man. Putting this interpretation upon it, the meaning of the expression <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kahiko pu</hi> becomes clear as being wrapped together, as in the sexual embrace.
</p><p>Wahine-oma&#8217;o was greatly fascinated by the pathos and romance of the situation and declared she would like to have her for an aikane, an intimate friend.
</p><p>Hiiaka replied, &#8220;Maimed folk seem to be very numerous in these parts.&#8221;
</p><p>The maimed girl kept up her fishing, her light-hearted dancing and singing:

</p><p>&#8220;The figure you see dancing down there is not a human body; it is only a spirit,&#8221; said Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, only a spirit, and I&#8217;ll prove it in this way,&#8221; she plucked a hala drupe from a wreath about her neck;&#8212;&#8220;I&#8217;ll throw this down to her; and if she flies away, it will prove she is a spirit; but, if she does not disappear, it will prove her to be a human body.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka threw the hala, and the moment the poor soul saw it fall in front of her she vanished out of sight. But in a short time she reappeared and, seizing the hala with her fingerless hand-stumps, she pressed it to her nose with an extravagant display of fondness and, looking up to Hiiaka, she chanted:

The only trouble will be to hold her after she is caught.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka, using her magical power, caught the spirit of Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea and, in the lack of a more suitable receptacle, they wrapped it carefully in the free end of Wahine-oma&#8217;o&#8217;s loin-cloth and went on their way, traveling towards Wailuku.



<pb id="pb73" n="73"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch17" n="XVII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XVII</head><head>HIIAKA RESTORES TO LIFE MANA-MANA-IA-KALU-EA</head><p>As they drew near Wailuku, they crossed a sandy plain dotted with tumuli. At once the captive spirit of Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea became restless, as if eager to be free. &#8220;We are nearing the place where rests its body,&#8221; explained Hiiaka. Wahine-oma&#8217;o by soft words and gentle touch did her best to soothe the perturbed thing.
</p><p>It might almost be said that the captive spirit of Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea was the guide (acting like the magnetic needle to point the way) to the home where the as-yet uncorrupted body of the girl still lay, mourned over by her parents<corr sic="..">.</corr>
</p><p>It was with much prayer and the use of persuasive force that Hiiaka compelled the seemingly reluctant spirit to reenter its bodily tenement and to take up its abode there. As it passed from its point of entrance at the toe up into the chest its progress was marked by a kindling warmth that gave the assurance that the spirit was resuming its empiry over the whole body.
</p><p>The first request made by the girl, on regaining full consciousness, was that her parents would prepare a feast as a thank-offering to Hiiaka, her physician, her deliverer. The special articles on which she was most insistent were luau and baked <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">aoaoa</hi>.<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Aoaoa</hi>, an imitative word, meaning dog.</note>
</p><p>When it came to the final dressing of the luau for the table, namely the stripping off of the outer leafy covering from the scalding hot mass within&#8212;an operation which the girl insisted on doing with her own newly restored hands&#8212;Hiiaka watched her critically; for the proper etiquette of the function was most punctilious. But Hiiaka could find no fault with her technique: there was no slip, no solecism, no blowing on her fingers to relieve the scalding heat, as she stripped off the wrappings of the bundles.
</p><p>When the feast was set and all were gathered about the tables, at Hiiaka&#8217;s command all bowed their heads with closed eyes and she offered up her prayer to the gods of heaven. At the conclusion of her prayer, when they looked, lo, the portion of the feast set apart for the gods had vanished without leaving a trace <pb id="pb74" n="74"/>behind. On this occasion Hiiaka was seen to eat of the food that was provided for her.<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b">The most acceptable <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne bouche</hi> that could be offered to Pele, or to Hiiaka, by way of refreshment, was the tender leaf of the taro plant. We of this day and generation eat it when cooked under the name of lu-au. In the old old times, when the gods walked on the earth, it was acceptable in the raw state under the name of <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">paha</hi>; but, when cooked, it was called <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pe&#8217;u</hi>. The word luau seems to be modern.</note>
</p><p>The line of travel now chosen by Hiiaka was that along the northern or Koolau side of the island of Maui and led them at first through a barren stretch of country called a kaha, the food-supply of which came from a distance. It was here that Wahine-oma&#8217;o began to complain bitterly of hunger and exhaustion from the lack of food, and she besought Hiiaka to intercede with the people of a neighboring fishing village to give them <corr sic="somethnig">something</corr> to eat.
</p><p>&#8220;How is this, that you are a-hungered so soon after the feast of which you have partaken? This is a kaha,&#8221; said Hiiaka, &#8220;and you must know that food does not grow in this place. They have only fish from the sea. Nevertheless, I will venture the request.&#8221; This she did in the language of song:
</p><lg id="lg74.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Ke kahulihuli a ka papa o Wailuku;
    </l><l>He ole ke kaha kuai ai, e:

</p><lg id="lg74.2" type="Group"><l>As trembles the plank at Wailuku
    </l><l>(So trembles the fate of the king):
    </l><l>There&#8217;s no market where to buy meat;
    </l><l>Give the stranger, then, something to eat:
    </l><l>Give us, I pray, of your meat.</l></lg><p>Some of the people derided them, saying, &#8220;Mahaoi!&#8221;&#8212;what impudence! Others, with kindness in their tones, explained, &#8220;This is a barren place; and all of our food comes from a great distance.&#8221; The churlish ones, however, kept up their taunts: &#8220;You won&#8217;t get any food in this place. Go up there;&#8221; and they pointed in the direction of Iao valley, where was the residence of King Ole-pau.
</p><p>During the whole of the day, while tramping through this <pb id="pb75" n="75"/>region, Hiiaka had observed from time to time a ghostly object flitting across the plain within hearing distance and in a direction parallel to their course. Though this spirit was not visible to ordinary mortal eye, Hiiaka recognized it as the second soul of Ole-pau, the very chief to whom the people of the fishing village had bid her make her appeal for food. Hiiaka, putting two and two together, very naturally came to the conclusion that this vagrant <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kino wailua</hi> was, in the last resort, responsible for this denial of hospitality to herself and her companion. Acting on this conclusion, Hiiaka made a captive of the vagrant soul and determined to hold it as a hostage for the satisfaction of her reasonable demands.
</p><p>On coming within speaking distance of the house where lived the woman Wai-hinano, who ostentatiously played the part of kahu and chief adviser to Ole-pau, Hiiaka made known her wish, concluding her appeal with ominous threats against the life of the king, in case her demands were not met:
</p><lg id="lg75.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>E <corr sic="Wai-hinano">Wai-hinanano</corr>, wahine a ka po&#8217;ipo&#8217;i,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Po&#8217;ipo&#8217;i.</hi> <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Po&#8217;i uhane</hi>, soul catching, was one of the tricks of Hawaiian black art and sorcery.</note> e,

In her distraction and rage she still maintained a defiant attitude:

But it was equally true that just as often as Wai-hinano had uttered her assurances that his trouble was but a trivial indisposition and that the male and female deities&#8212;above named&#8212;stood on his side and would not let him die, his courage had revived, he had felt a wave of healing influence pass through him and relief had come.
</p><p>In explanation of this see-saw of hope and despair, sickness and relief, let it be stated that the two goddesses Ha-pu&#8217;u and Ka-lei-hau-ola and the two male deities Ke-olo-ewa and Kama-ua, to whom Wai-hinano had appealed by name as staunch friends of Ka-ula-hea, were, in fact, allies, or, more properly speaking, partizans of Pele and, therefore, subject to the call of Hiiaka. The kahuna Kaua-kahi-ma-hiku-lani who had charge of the case of Ka-ula-hea derived his power as a kahuna from these very same gods; but he well knew that if there was a conflict of interests the commands of Hiiaka would have to be carried out. As for the gods and goddesses above named, they, of course, knew their own position and that, as between Ka-ula-hea and Hiiaka, their service must be rendered to the latter. Willing enough they were, however, in return for the offerings laid on their altars, to feed the hopes of the sick man by temporary relief of his sharpest agonies.
</p><p>As if this tangle of motives were not enough, the affair was yet further complicated by the appearance of Kapo&#8212;sister, or aunt of Hiiaka&#8212;on the scene, who came not only as an interested spectator but as a friend of king Ka-ula-hea. Her power to intervene was, of course, handicapped by the same limitations that touched the other gods and goddesses. She had the good sense to retire from the scene before things came to a critical pass.
</p><p>Meanwhile messengers are flying about, seeking or bringing assurance of relief and restoration to health to the king. Hiiaka saw that the time had come for decisive action. She went close up to the great stone Paha-lele that still lies in the road near Wai-he&#8217;e and, before smiting against the rock the soul she held captive in her hand, she uttered the following kau:
</p><lg id="lg80.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>E Kaua-kahi-ma-hiku-lani ma, e,

</p><p>There was something in the manner of Hiiaka as she called the name of the kahuna Kau-akahi that chilled the courage of the group of sorcery gods. They saw that their game was played out, and they sneaked away and hid themselves.

This was because she foresaw that she would be importuned to use her power to restore the dead king to life.
</p><p>When these akuas, these spirits of necromancy, became convinced that they had been worsted in the fight and that the king was dead beyond all hope of recovery from them, they instructed the kahuna Kaua-kahi-ma-hiku-lani to desist from his useless incantations and to dispatch all his people in search of Hiiaka as the only one capable of reviving the king&#8217;s life.
</p><p>While toiling up the ascent of the hill Pulehu, the two women saw in the distance a great multitude of people pursuing them. Wahine-oma&#8217;o, in alarm, exclaimed<corr>,</corr> &#8220;What in the world shall we do!&#8221; At once Hiiaka by the power of enchantment changed Wahine-oma&#8217;o into the shape of a little girl leading a dog, while she herself assumed the form of a bent old woman hobbling along with the aid of a stick; and as the multitude drew near they sat down by the wayside as if to rest.
</p><p>The people in pursuit had seen and recognized Hiiaka and felt sure of soon overtaking her. But, on coming to the place, they found only a decrepit woman and a child leading a dog. They were taken aback and asked, &#8220;Where are the two young women who were traveling this way? Have you not seen them?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;We have seen nothing of them,&#8221; was the answer.
</p><p>When the people reported to the kahuna that they had found only an old woman and a girl with a dog in tow, he saw through the trick at once and exclaimed, &#8220;Those are the very persons I want. Go and bring them.&#8221;
</p><p>The messengers of the kahuna next came up with Hiiaka and her companion at a place called Ka-lau-la&#8217;ola&#8217;o. There they found two girls of tender age busily employed in gathering lehua flowers and stringing them into wreaths; and, as before, they denied all sight and knowledge of the persons inquired for. The kahuna recognized that his people had again been victimized <pb id="pb83" n="83"/>and, upbraiding them for their lack of detective insight, ordered them to renew the pursuit.
</p><p>Once more, at Kapua, in Ka-ana-pali, did Hiiaka find it necessary to resort to the arts of magic in order to escape from her pursuers. When the scouts of the kahuna arrived at the place they found a household of busy women&#8212;a wrinkled matronly figure was braiding a mat, while her companion, just returned from the ocean, was laying a fire to broil a fish for the evening meal. Not until they had gone some distance from the place did it occur to their sharpening wits that the house had looked spick-and-span new, and that they had seen no <hi>man</hi> about the place. Yes&#8212;they had been fooled again by the wonderful art of the girl Hiiaka.
</p><p>Hiiaka was rejoiced to find a canoe on the point of sailing to Moloka&#8217;i and the sailors gladly consented to give her a passage. The people of Kapua were greatly taken with the beauty and charm of Hiiaka and proposed, in all seriousness, that she should remain and become one of them. When they found that she was insistent to continue her journey at once, they one and all warned her not to attempt the windward side of <corr sic="Molokai">Moloka&#8217;i</corr>, declaring its coast to be precipitous and impassable, besides being infested by a band of man-killing mo&#8217;o.
</p><p>Hiiaka had no sooner set foot on Molokai&#8217;s beach than her ears were assailed with complaints against those lawless beings, the mo&#8217;o. Two women, pallid and wasted with starvation, sat in the open field moaning and bewailing their estate. At sight of Hiiaka, as if recognizing their knight errant, they broke out into loud lamentations. The mo&#8217;o had robbed them of their husbands, and with them had gone their means of support and their very desire for food. Hiiaka, as if recognizing their claim upon her knight-errantry, with heartfelt sympathy for their miserable condition, opened her mouth in song:
</p><lg id="lg83.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Kui na ohi&#8217;a hele i ke kaha, e;
    </l><l>Lei hele i ke kaha o Ka-pala-ili-ahi&#8212;

    </l><l>These creatures, sublime in their misery,
    </l><l>Sit shelterless, wasted, forlorn.</l></lg><p>At this the women spoke up and said: &#8220;Our bodies are wasted only from our passionate love for our husbands. When they were taken from us we refused food.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka was indignant at such folly and left them to their fate. Their way still continued for some distance through a barren region and Hiiaka again alluded in song to the barrenness of the land and the misery of the women who suffered their bodies to waste away:
</p><lg id="lg84.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Kui na apiki lei hele

    </l><l>Their&#8217;s merely a passion hysteric,
    </l><l>That shrivels the body like famine.</l></lg><p>The good people of Halawa valley, where Hiiaka found herself well received, made earnest protest against the madness of her determination to make her way along the precipitous coast wall that formed <corr sic="Molokai&#8217;s">Moloka&#8217;i&#8217;s</corr> windward rampart. The route, they said, was impassable. Its overhanging cliffs, where nested the tropic-bird and the ua&#8217;u, dropped the plummet straight into the boiling ocean. Equally to be dreaded was a nest of demonlike creatures, mo&#8217;o, that infested the region and had their headquarters at Kiki-pua, which gave name to the chief mo&#8217;o. Kiki-pua, being of the female sex, generally chose the form of a woman as a disguise to her character which combined the fierceness and blood-thirstiness of the serpent with the shifty resources of witchcraft, thus enabling her to assume a great variety of physical <pb id="pb85" n="85"/>shapes, as suited her purpose. This last fact, had it stood by itself, would have decided Hiiaka&#8217;s choice; for her journey, considered as a pilgrimage, had as an important side-purpose the extermination root-and-branch, of the whole cursed tribe of mo&#8217;o from one end of the land to the other.
</p><p>(This Kiki-pua band of mo&#8217;o had included Haka-a&#8217;ano, the husband of Kiki-pua, also Papala-ua and her husband Oloku&#8217;i.<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Oloku&#8217;i</hi>, a high bluff that overlooks Pele-kunu and Wailau, valleys on Moloka&#8217;i.</note> Kiki-pua had stolen away and taken to herself Oloku&#8217;i, the husband of Papala-ua, thus creating a bitter feud which broke up the solidarity of the band.)
</p><p>The way chosen by Hiiaka led along the precipitous face of the mountain by a trail that offered at the best only a precarious foothold or clutch for the hand. At one place a clean break opened sheer and straight into the boiling sea. As they contemplated this <hi>impasse</hi>, a plank, narrow and tenuous, seemed to bridge the abyss. Wahine-oma&#8217;o, rejoicing at the way thus offered, promptly essayed to set foot upon it, thinking thus to make the passage. Hiiaka held her back, and on the instant the bridgelike structure vanished. It was the tongue of the mo&#8217;o thrust out in imitation of a plank, a device to lure Hiiaka and her companion to their destruction.
</p><p>Hiiaka, not to be outdone as a wonder-worker, spanned the abyss by stretching across it her own magical pa-&#250;, and over this, as on a bridge, she and Wahine-oma&#8217;o passed in security.
</p><p>The mo&#8217;o, Kiki-pua, took flight and hid among the cavernous rocks. But that did not avail for safety. Hiiaka gave chase and, having caught her, put an end to the life of the miserable creature. Thus did Hiiaka take another step towards ridding the land of the mo&#8217;o.

The real embarrassment lay in the super-gallantry of the two sailors who manned the canoe. When the two men looked upon Hiiaka and Wahine-oma&#8217;o, they were so taken with admiration for their beauty and attractiveness, that they sneaked out of a previous engagement to take their own wives along with them, trumping up some shuffling excuse about the canoe being overladen.
</p><p>Arriving at the desolate landing near the wild promontory of Maka-pu&#8217;u, it was only by a piece of well-timed duplicity that Hiiaka and her companion managed to shake off the sailors and relieve themselves from their excessive attentions.
</p><p>While in mid channel, in sight of Ulu-ma-wao, a promontory whose name was the same as a near relative of the Pele family, Hiiaka poured out this reminiscence in song:

The consideration that turned the scale in favor of the Koolau route was that thus she would have sight of a large number of aunts and uncles, members of the Pele family, whose ghosts still clung to the dead volcanic cones and headlands which stood as relics of their bygone activities, and where they eked out a miserable existence. The region was thickly strewn with these skeleton forms. Hiiaka first addressed herself to Maka-pu&#8217;u:

Offerings were necessary, not for her physical but for her spiritual sustenance. The burnt offering was not merely pleasing for its sweet smelling savour, it was an <corr sic="ailment">aliment</corr> necessary to the creature&#8217;s continued existence. For the same or a parallel reason, songs of praise and adulation (kanaenae) were equally acceptable and equally efficacious. Cut off the flowers of speech as well as the offerings of its worshippers, and a kupua would soon dwindle into nothingness.

<pb id="pb89" n="89"/></p><p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; answered Malei: &#8220;the only food to be had in this desolate spot is the herbage that grows hereabouts; and for clothing we have to put up with such clouts as are tossed us by travelers. When the wind blows one has but to open his mouth to get his belly full. That has been our plight since your sister left us two old people here.

</p><p>As they traveled on Maka-pu&#8217;u and its neighbor hills passed out of sight. Arriving at Ka-ala-pueo, they caught view of the desolate hill Pohaku-loa, faint, famished, forlorn. The sight of it drew from Hiiaka this chanting utterance:

</p><p>To speak again of the kupua Malei, a few years ago, as I am told, a Hawaiian woman on entering a certain cave in the region of Wai-manalo, found herself confronted with a stone figure, from which glowed like burning coals a group of eight flaming eyes, being set in deep sockets in the stone. This rare object was soon recognized as the bodily dwelling of the kupua Malei. This little monolith at a later time came into the possession of Mr. John Cummins of <corr sic="Waimanalo">Wai-manalo</corr>.

It was in the mood and spirit begotten of such experiences that she sang:

Hiiaka did not flinch in her attack. When she had killed the monster, she set up his flukes as a landmark which now forms the rock known to this day as Moko-li&#8217;i. The body of the dragon she disposed in such a way that it helped form the road-bed of the traveled highway. After this achievement she vented her feelings in an exultant song:

He bemoaned his fate as that of a malihini god, a stranger to the rest of the group. On being roused by this prayer-song of Hiiaka, as he gazed upon the beautiful goddess, a divine ambition stirred within him&#8212;to journey with her, enjoy her society, and make acquaintance with the land to which he was still a stranger. With this purpose in mind, at the conclusion of her address, he chanted this response:
</p><lg id="lg93.2" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O Pele la ko&#8217;u akua:

A clear understanding of these words calls for a reference to the customs, that had almost the dignity of a rite, that were observed in the handling of awa for purposes of worship, or as an offering to the gods. This began with the very digging of the awa root. He who did this had first to purify himself by a bath in the ocean, followed by an ablution in fresh water and completing the lustration with an aspersion of water containing turmeric, administered by a priest. Then, having arrayed himself in a clean malo, he knelt with both knees upon the ground and tore the root from its bed. Now, rising to his feet, he lifted the awa root to heaven, and by this act the awa was dignified and was called <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">awa i-ku</hi>. The utterance (by the priest?) of the kanaenae, or prayer of consecration and eulogy, still further enhanced this dignity and set it apart as a special sacrifice to some god, or to the gods of some class. Awa thus consecrated was known as <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">awa i-lani</hi>.</note> awa i-lani,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b" sameAs="n116a"/> keia awa,

The same name was applied also to the breath of life, and to the kahuna&#8217;s power of healing. In the Maori tongue the word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mauri</hi> means life, the seat of life. In Samoan <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mauli</hi> means heart; in Hawaiian it means to faint. &#8220;Sneeze, living heart&#8221; (&#8220;<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Tihe, mauri ora</hi>&#8221;), says the New Zealand mother to her infant when it utters a sneeze.

The thought that Hiiaka should countenance his perpetual imprisonment in the bleak cliff filled him with rage. With a mighty effort he lifted himself and tore away the covering of tree-roots, earth and rocks that embraced him until he came to a crouching position. That was the limit of his power: he could do no more. A stony form in the mountain wall of Kahana, resembling the shape of a man on all-fours, remains to vouch for the truth of this legend.

Having chosen his station at Kaena Point, the western extremity of Oahu, from which the island of Kaua&#8217;i is clearly visible on a bright day, he cast his wonderful hook, Mana-ia-ka-lani, far out into the ocean that it might engage itself in the foundations of Kaua&#8217;i. When he felt that it had taken a good hold, he gave a mighty tug at the line. A huge bowlder, the Pohaku o Kaua&#8217;i, fell at his feet. The mystic hook, having freed itself from its entanglement, dropped into Palolo Valley and hollowed out the crater, that is its grave. This failure to move the whole mass of the island argues no engineering miscalculation on Mawi&#8217;s part. It was due to the underhand working of spiritual forces. Had Mawi been more politic, more observant of spiritual etiquette, more diplomatic in his dealings with the heavenly powers, his ambitious plans would, no doubt, have met with better success.</note> e,

He was lame and unable to walk. For this reason his wife, Wailua-nui-a-hoano, had carried him down to the seashore and, leaving him there to his fishing, had gone home to her work of tapa-making.

</p><p>Malae-ha&#8217;a-koa, lame, guileless, innocent of all transgression, meanwhile, sat and fished. He had cast afresh his triple-hooked line, blown from his mouth into the water the comminuted fragments of the shrimps whose bodies baited his hooks and, as he waited for a bite he chanted a song (to the god of good luck) that reached Hiiaka&#8217;s ear:

Some new and wonderful power had come into his life. In the first flush of his ecstacy, he gathered up his fishing tackle, thrust the hooks and lines into his basket and walked triumphantly home on his own feet. Without a word to his wife, he began to tear down a portion of the fence that enclosed the house-lot.
</p><p>&#8220;What are you about?&#8221; exclaimed his wife; &#8220;tearing down our fence!... But what has happened to you? Here you are for the first time in many years able to walk on your feet!&#8221;
</p><p>The man made no immediate reply, but kept on with his work. When she repeated her questionings and expressions of wonder, <pb id="pb112" n="112"/>he quietly asked, &#8220;Have you not seen two women about the place?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;There were two women who came this way,&#8221; she answered thoughtfully.
</p><p>&#8220;Would you think it! They were divine beings,&#8221; he exclaimed in a tone of conviction. &#8220;We must spread for them a feast. You had better prepare some luau.&#8221;
</p><p>Malae-ha&#8217;a-koa himself, alii as he was, with his own hands set about dressing and preparing a dog for the oven. This was his own token of service. At his command his people brought the material for an abundant feast.

</p><p>When the repast was nearing its end and the people had well eaten, Malae-ha&#8217;a-koa and his wife stood forth and led in the performance of a sacred dance, accompanying their rhythmic motions with a long mele that recited the deeds, the events, the mysteries that had marked Pele&#8217;s reign since the establishment of her dominion in Hawaii:

Some, including J. W. P., think it may be the shortened, poetical form of ko&#8217;iko&#8217;i, heavy, referring to the timber used in building a temple for the deity. Others take the view that the word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ko&#8217;i</hi> should be given its face-value. I see in it a possible reference to pahoehoe, the plates of which, in their hot and nascent state, are capable of felling a forest as effectively as a <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ko&#8217;i</hi>. One expounder (Pelei-oho-lani) finds in this word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ko&#8217;i</hi> a reference to a symbolical lifting of the thumb of the left hand as a sign of prayer. The arguments on the one side and on the other are not quite convincing.</note>

The koa tree has been felled and rudely fashioned; a strong line is made fast to one end of it, and the men, having ranged themselves along, rope in hand, their chief, sometimes standing on the log itself, gives the signal for them to be ready for a start by uttering the inspiring cry &#8220;I ku mau-mau wa!&#8221; &#8220;I ku mau wa,&#8221; answer the men, and with a mighty pull the huge log starts on its way to its ocean-home.</note>

</p><p>&#8220;I have come to escort Lohiau as a lover to the bed of Pele,&#8221; said Hiiaka.

</p><p>&#8220;Let that be as it may,&#8221; Hiiaka answered; &#8220;I will go and see for myself.&#8221;
</p><p>Now Kahua-nui, the sister of Lohiau, had laid his body to rest in a sepulcher close to her own residence; but on examination the place was found to be empty. It was evident that the body had been spirited away. Hiiaka, turning her gaze to the mountain, discerned a ghostly form standing at the mouth of a cave. It was the ghost of Lohiau. In an effort to soothe and attract him, Hiiaka, with arms extended and face uplifted, in passionate utterance gave vent to her emotions:

At second view, the ghostly unreality of the tenuous image so greatly shocked her imagination by its contrast to her ideal of a true flesh-and-blood lover, that she amended her first utterance:

But it was not there. It had been stolen away by the two mo&#8217;o-witches (Kilioe and Ka-lana-mai-nu&#8217;u) and lodged in a cave high up in the inaccessible mountain side.

One may infer from their use that Halau-a-ola meant rather a sort of house-of-refuge, a place of security from the attack of an enemy, while Mauli-ola had in view a mystical, beatific, condition. The former is illustrated in the line describing Kama-pua&#8217;a&#8217;s escape from Pele&#8217;s onslaught:

</p><p>Hiiaka and her companion conquered the impossible and scaled the mountain wall as if their feet had the clinging property of the fly. Lohiau&#8217;s ghost would have escaped, but with birdlike quickness she caught it. At her command Wahine-oma&#8217;o gathered certain aromatic and fragrant herbs of the wilderness, and having made a fire, they bruised and warmed the <corr sic="simples">samples</corr> and spread them upon a sheet of leaves.
</p><p>While Wahine-oma&#8217;o kept fast hold of the feet, Hiiaka forced the soul-particle to pass in through one of the eye-sockets. It went as far as the cavity of the chest, then turned back and strove to escape. Hiiaka guarded the ways of exit and with skillful manipulations compelled it to go on. Reaching the loins, it balked again; but Hiiaka&#8217;s art conquered its resistance and the human particle extended its journey to the feet. There was a twitching of these parts; the hands began to move, the eye-lids to quiver; breath once more entered the body. They lifted and laid it on the blanket of aromatics and restoratives, swathing it from head to foot.
</p><p>Hiiaka set a calabash of water before her and, addressing Wahine-oma&#8217;o, said, &#8220;Listen to my prayer. If it is correct and faultless, our man will live; but if it is wrong or imperfect, he will die.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;He will not survive,&#8221; replied Wahine-oma&#8217;o gloomily.

</p><p>The question&#8212;asked by Wahine-oma&#8217;o&#8212;how they were to climb down from their inaccessible position was answered by the sudden appearance of three rainbows that arched themselves conveniently at their feet, and on these, as on ladders, they climbed from the dizzy height to the sleeping village below. Under the priestly guidance of Hiiaka, they all now resorted to the ocean and with the aid of its waters performed the rite of cleansing from the ceremonial defilement that came from the touch of a corpse. With this cleansing each one of them seemed to have a new birth of physical perfection. As they came up out of the water their bodies seemed actually to glow with a fresh and radiant beauty.
</p><p>The touch of salt water woke in Lohiau a longing he could not resist. He took his surf-board and, with face to the incoming rollers, made for the open sea. The place was one where he had often sported before, prescriptive custom having in fact set it apart for the exclusive use of the chiefs.
</p><p>The &#8220;fish&#8221;&#8212;as the Hawaiians called the Milky way&#8212;was already declining in the west and beginning to pale at the approach of a new day, and Lohiau still rode the waves.
</p><p>That same night Kahua-nui, Lohiau&#8217;s sister, woke from her sleep with a start. She went out of doors and, lifting her eyes to the mountain wall, saw a light gleaming in the cave where lay her brother&#8217;s body. She rubbed her eyes to remove the cobwebs of sleep&#8212;yes, there it was, a quivering light, set like an eye in the socket of the mountain wall, and figures moving about. She rushed back into the house where slept her husband and stirred him with her foot.
</p><p>&#8220;What are you about!&#8221; demanded the man. &#8220;Do you want to kill me?&#8221;
<pb id="pb153" n="153"/></p><p>&#8220;Get up; there&#8217;s a fire burning in the cave, up the mountain. Come!&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;What crazy fit possesses you,&#8221; muttered the man as he went out. &#8220;To knock my wind out with such a kick!&#8212;and there&#8217;s no fire up there, merely a star sinking in the west. That&#8217;s all there was to it. Go to bed!&#8221;
</p><p>The woman was silenced but not convinced. Her sleep continued to be broken. She fancied that she heard a human voice calling to her; yet, on listening, she could distinguish only the moaning of the surf. In her restlessness she wandered forth again and stood in the cool vault of night. The endless monotone of the ocean filled her ears, but it told her nothing new. She sought her bed again and turned her face to the mat in a resolute effort to sleep. She dozed, but the subtle goddess evaded her. Thoughts of her brother floated through her mind, and the booming of the surf now seemed to assume a more intimate tone and by some witchery of the imagination led her out under the winking stars, closer to old Ocean&#8217;s moan, and made her think: how Lohiau did delight in the surf; what pleasure he took in riding the billows! Thus she murmured to herself. At that moment her straining vision detected an object moving with the waves. &#8220;Some man surfing in our tabu waters&#8212;yet how can that be? Have not all the men of the village gone over to Niihau? Paoa urged them to go.&#8221; She moved along the beach. By this time it was dawn.
</p><p>&#8220;There comes a woman,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o.
</p><p>&#8220;His sister, Kahua-nui,&#8221; Hiiaka remarked quietly.
</p><p>Wahine-oma&#8217;o called to her by name and went forward to meet her.
</p><p>&#8220;Ah, it is you two women,&#8221; Kahua-nui exclaimed.
</p><p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your husband?&#8221; Wahine-oma&#8217;o asked.
</p><p>&#8220;Asleep in the house.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Go and call him; tell him to take his canoe and go over to Niihau and bring Paoa,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o. &#8220;Lohiau is alive and well. Look, there he comes on the surf-board.&#8221;
</p><p>In a tumult of joy the woman ran to the house and shouted the tidings to her husband. Nakoa-ola, girding his malo about him as he came out of the door, made all speed for the halau; shoved the canoe down the slope of the beach; looked to the lashings of the outrigger; saw that the paddles, bailer and what not were in place; stepped the mast; arranged the sail and the <pb id="pb154" n="154"/>sheet; then, with a final push, he leaped in astern and set his course for Niihau.
</p><p>The story of Lohiau&#8217;s miraculous return to life spread like wild fire until the whole population of the little island of Niihau was buzzing with the wonder. Paoa, in his haste and excitement, neglected the ordinary civilities and failed to invite his visitor to &#8220;come in and eat.&#8221; They took canoe on the instant and were the first to arrive at Haena.
</p><p>At sight of Lohiau, whom they found quiet and thoughtful, surrounded by a houseful of people, in conversation with his sister and two women who were strangers, they set up a wailing cry of joy that was chorused by the whole company.
</p><p>The great raft of attendants, men and women, round-eyed with wonder, reached Haena in successive arrivals later in the day. First came those who eagerly credited the report of Lohiau&#8217;s resurrection; scattering along after them, strangers and those who were in any degree skeptical of this great mystery. Each hour saw a bunch of new arrivals, not from Niihau alone but from all parts of Kauai.
</p><p>When Kahua-nui and her husband had first wept over Lohiau, embracing and kissing him, uttering their welcome in joyous cries of wailing, they turned to the two women, the strangers, for Lohiau bade them extend their welcome to &#8220;these two women who have brought me to life again.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Where are they from?&#8221; Kahua-nui asked.
</p><p>&#8220;I know not; I only know they have given me life.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;It was worth while for my brother to have died to secure two such beautiful women as you,&#8221; said Kahua-nui as she faced Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;The other one is more beautiful than we are,&#8221; Hiiaka answered.
</p><p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Toward the Sunrise,&#8221; Hiiaka answered.
</p><p>&#8220;What is the name of the country?&#8221; queried Kahua-nui.
</p><p>&#8220;Hawaii.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Who is the woman<corr sic=",">?</corr>&#8221; persisted Kahua-nui.
</p><p>&#8220;Her name is Pele.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I know her.&#8221; Kahua-nui spoke with lower tone.
</p><p>&#8220;She it was who sent us to fetch Lohiau. We found him dead. I worked according to my ability&#8212;you see, our man is alive again.&#8221;



<pb id="pb155" n="155"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch28" n="XXVIII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XXVIII</head><head>THE GODS COME TO LOHIAU&#8217;S FEAST</head><p>Under the direction of Kahua-nui&#8212;the woman to whom belonged the executive mind&#8212;proclamation was made throughout the land, in the name of Lohiau, commanding all the people to collect the necessary food and material in preparation for a great feast, that they might celebrate properly Lohiau&#8217;s return to life.
</p><p>It was to be an occasion of <corr sic="unparalled">unparalleled</corr> interest and importance: a chief, famed for his manly beauty and popular talents, rescued from the grave; the magician who had accomplished this marvel, a woman of surpassing beauty; an old-time feast, with its lavish profusion; the hula, with its lyric and epic thrills: a combination of attractions that appealed to every taste, whether of sage, epicure, frivolous dilettante or dull-witted peasant, it was sure to be the event of a lifetime. All were invited and all came.
</p><p>The halau in which the people assembled was a temple of Flora, or rather of her Polynesian sister L&#225;ka. At the request of Hiiaka, whose every wish was law, one half of the hall was screened off by a rustic partition as a special feasting hall for the gods. &#8220;My relatives,&#8221; said Hiiaka, &#8220;are numerous.&#8221;
</p><p>In this part of the halau were laid the sacrificial viands for the supply of an immense host. Having commanded silence, Hiaaka, after the manner of prayer, invited the attendance of the gods. A hush fell upon the assembly; the air was stirred by the fanning of many wings. No speech, no human voice, only the gentle clash of wooden dishes, the rustle of leaves, the gurgle of deep potations and the subdued sounds of gustation came from the place into which no human foot or eye dared intrude. At the conclusion of the affair, when Hiiaka, in priestly fashion, had pronounced the absolving word <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">noa</hi> and the stewards were again at liberty to enter the precinct where the immortals had just now celebrated their symposium, it seemed, at first glance, as if nothing had been touched. The leafy bundles of fish and fowl and meat remained unopened, but they proved to be empty; the coconuts, unbroken, were yet devoid of meat; the bananas were found to be but hollow skins. The substance, the essence, had been filched away by some inscrutable power. This was the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ai inoino</hi>&#8212;consumption to the last morsel&#8212;practiced by the gods.
<pb id="pb156" n="156"/></p><p>It was a solemn affair, after all, this parting feast, at which, in spite of the babel of voices, weighty affairs had to be settled. Malae-ha&#8217;a-koa published the fact that the beautiful woman who sat in their mist was Hiiaka, the sister of Pele; that her art had captured the unhappy flitting ghost of Lohiau, restored it to its renovated and matchless form and that, in fulfillment of her errand, she was about to lead him away with her to be the bed-mate of the goddess who ruled the volcano.
</p><p>Paoa&#8212;he whose tempestuous nature had not long ago sworn vengeance against the author of Lohiau&#8217;s taking-off&#8212;now spoke up and declared his purpose to go with his master on this his new and strange adventure. Lohiau restrained him.
</p><p>&#8220;I go with these two women. If I die&#8212;so be it&#8212;&#8217;twere a glorious end,&#8212;with these two who rescued me from the grave and brought me back to the delights of your society. If I live and make my abode on Hawaii, it will be for you to come and share the blessings of my new home.&#8221; Then, addressing himself specially to Paoa, &#8220;You will remain here, as my deputy, ruling over the land. If my adventure fares well, I will come and fetch you&#8212;if ... ill, your coming would not advantage.... You shall stay here.&#8221;



</p></div1><div1 id="ch29" n="XXIX" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XXIX</head><head>HIIAKA&#8217;S ADDRESS TO CAPE KAENA</head><p>The mountains were still in shadow, but the star of morning was on high and rosy fingers in the east heralded the approach of day, taming the flare of the torches and making them almost a superfluity as the canoe&#8212;with Hiiaka occupying the pola, Lohiau in the stern holding the steersman&#8217;s paddle and Wahine-oma&#8217;o ensconced in the bow&#8212;curvetted to the waves and shot out into the blue sea. One paddle-stroke and the craft had cleared the land, another and it had traversed the heaving channel of I&#235;-i&#235;-waena, another and it was beached on the sands of Mokuleia. At this point Hiiaka parted from her two companions, directing them to call for her with the canoe at a designated place.
</p><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s first care was to pay her respects to the aged one, her ancestor, Pohaku-o-Kaua&#8217;i; after that to her ancestral divinity <pb id="pb157" n="157"/>Kaena, a name in modern times bestowed on the western cape of Oahu. She turned this point and passed into the sweltering lea where the sun poured its merciless heat and, as she climbed the slope of the Waianae mountain, looking back on the route just accomplished, according to her custom, she uttered her comments in song:

By this happy reunion the otherwise dissevered narrative is brought into harmony and conflicting versions no longer pull away from each other like two ill-trained steers.
</p><p>The voyage was not without enlivening incident. When the canoe had reached a point where the surges began to roll in the direction of Oahu Hiiaka saw two monster sharks disporting themselves in the waves whom she recognized as relatives on the side of her paternal grand-father, their names being Kua and Kahole-a-Kane. This was her second encounter with these sea-monsters; the first was on her recent voyage to Kauai, an encounter which had threatened serious results, if not disaster, to Hiiaka&#8217;s expedition. As the story goes, when Kua and Kahole had become aware that Hiiaka&#8217;s going was for the purpose of bringing Lohiau to the bed of Pele, they were moved to great disapproval of her enterprise: &#8220;A mere man,&#8221; said they. &#8220;The idea of mating him with Pele is atrocious: and he is a dead man at that.&#8221;
</p><p>After taking counsel with the sea-goddess Moana-nui-ka-lehua, who had her boudoir in the deep waters of I&#235;i&#235;-waena, with her aid they raised a commotion in the sea and Hiiaka barely escaped being swamped by a mighty water-spout. For her part Hiiaka was quite ready to overlook this rough play of her old kinsfolk and to do the agreeable with them and she accordingly addressed them kindly: &#8220;How lucky for me is this meeting again with you out here in the ocean! It will enable me to relieve my hardships by a smack of real comfort.&#8221;
</p><p>The two sea-monsters felt unable to respond to Hiiaka&#8217;s advances in a like spirit with her&#8217;s. Their consciences <corr sic="plead">pleaded</corr> guilty. &#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Kua to his fellow, &#8220;this is our grandchild.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; his companion replied, &#8220;and she will put us to death. We&#8217;d better hide ourselves, you in your patch of surf, I in mine.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;That sort of a ruse won&#8217;t avail us in the least,&#8221; objected Kua.
</p><p>&#8220;What then? Where shall we flee for safety?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;To the mountains back of Waianae, to be sure,&#8221; asserted Kua.


<figure id="p160"><head>THE DESCENT FROM THE CLIFFS</head></figure>

</p><p>This suggestion meeting with the approval of his companion, they hastened to land and, having divested themselves of their shark-bodies and resumed human form, they made for the mountains and hid themselves in the pala&#225; fern. Hiiaka was greatly disappointed that these two old people should have so utterly misconceived <pb id="pb161" n="161"/>her attitude of mind toward them as to rob her of their interesting company.

They continued their flight along the same path which was soon afterwards followed by Hiiaka in her climb to Poha-kea. The only penalty inflicted by Hiiaka, when at last she came up with them and found them penitent, cowering in the brush, was their retirement from the ocean: not a light stroke, however, being almost the equivalent of taking away a mariner&#8217;s commission, thus separating him from his chosen element, his native air.

Her eyes, under the inspiration of the moment, disregard the ocean foreground, on whose gently heaving bosom might be seen the canoe that holds Lohiau and Wahine-oma&#8217;o snailing along to its appointed rendezvous. Her mind is busy interpreting the unusual signs written in the heavens: a swelling mountainous mass of flame-shot clouds, boiling up from some hidden source. It spells ruin and desolation&#8212;her own forest-parks blasted and fire-smitten; but, saddest and most heart-rending of all is the thought that her own Hopoe, the beautiful, the accomplished, the generous, the darling of her heart&#8212;Hopoe <pb id="pb163" n="163"/>has been swallowed up in the rack. Hopoe, whose accepted emblem and favorite poetical metamorphosis was a tall lehua tree in full blossom, is now a scarred rock teetotumed back and forth by the tides and waves of the ocean. This thought, however much she would put it aside, remained to fester in her heart.

It is necessary to explain that, on landing <pb id="pb164" n="164"/>at Mokuleia, she had ordered her two companions to continue their voyage and meet her on the other side of Cape Kaena whose pointed beak lay close at hand. Lohiau, nothing loath&#8212;a pretty woman was company enough for him&#8212;turned the prow of the canoe seaward and resumed his paddle. After passing the cape, the ocean calmed, making the work of steering much less arduous. Now it was that Lohiau, feeling the warm blood of young manhood swell the cockles of his heart and finding opportunity at hand, made ardent love to his attractive voyage-companion. He pressed nose and lip against her&#8217;s and used every argument to bring her to accept his point of view.
</p><p>Wahine-oma&#8217;o had a mind of her own and <corr sic="thought">though</corr> not at all averse to love and its doings and though very much drawn to this lover in particular, she decidedly objected to compromising her relations with Hiiaka, but above all, with the dread mistress of the Volcano, with whom she must ere long make reckoning. Like Pele, Wahine-oma&#8217;o permitted the kisses of Lohiau for a time, but, knowing that passion grows by what it feeds on, she presently cut short his rations and told him to behave himself, enforcing her denial with the unanswerable argument that she was well persuaded that they would be seen by Hiiaka. It was even so. It was worse. Hiiaka did not content herself with throwing temptation before Lohiau, as one might place raw meat before a hungry dog; by some witchery of psychologic power she stirred him up to do and dare, yet at the same time she impelled Wahine-oma&#8217;o to accept, but only a certain degree, for she carefully set bounds to their conduct. And this, be it understood, is but the opening act of a campaign in which Hiiaka resolves to avenge herself on Pele.
</p><p>When at length Hiiaka centered her attention on the actions of the people in the canoe, it needed but a glance to tell her that the contagium planted in the soil of Lohiau&#8217;s mind had worked to a charm. Her own description&#8212;though in figures that seem high-wrought and foreign to our imaginations&#8212;had better tell the tale:

It is explained that the meaning covered by this figure is a storm-cloud and that the stripping off of its garment, <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">wehe ... i kona kapa</hi>, meant its break up into the fleecy white clouds of fair weather.

The scene made such an appeal to Hiiaka&#8217;s imagination that she opened her heart in song:

Pele-ula, very naturally, declined this kind offer, but with a fine show of hospitality in her turn begged that they would honor her by being her guests during their stay in the place, assuring them of hospitable entertainment and such pleasures as her court could offer. Under her piloting, accordingly, they made their way by paddle across the beautiful land-locked harbor of Kou and, entering the Nu&#8217;uanu stream&#8212;in those days much broader, sweeter and deeper than now&#8212;turned into its eastern branch and erelong found themselves at the landing from which a path led up to Pele-ula&#8217;s residence. Imagine the fairy scene, if you will;&#8212;a canoe-load of smiling nereids piloted by a mermaid princess swimming on ahead, with a merry convoy of mermaiden and mermen following in the wake.
</p><p>A word in regard to this little land, now lying close to the heart of Honolulu itself, which still bears the same name as its old-time mistress, Pele-ula. To the kamaaina the sturdy samang tree, whose vigorous bole parts the traffic of Vineyard Street just before its junction with the highway of Nu&#8217;uanu has long been a familiar object. This fine tree has a history of its own and can claim the respectable age of not less than forty years. The land about it has borne the classic name of Pele-ula for a period of centuries that hark back to the antiquity of Hawaiian tradition. The sightseer of to-day who views the region from the macadamized roadway, some ten feet above the level of the surrounding land, must not judge of its former attractiveness and fitness as a place of residence by its present insalubrity&#8212;now shut in by embankments, overhung by dank and shadowy trees, its once-pure stream either diverted for economic purposes or cluttered and defiled with the debris of civilization. A study of the region, on the inner&#8212;<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mauka</hi>&#8212;border of which lies Pele-ula, will easily convince the observer that within a short geologic period the wash of silt and mud from higher levels has filled in and converted what must have been at one time a clear salt-water basin into the swampy flats that not long ago met the eye. Now, of course, this whole alluvial basin has been still further filled in and artificially overlaid with a more-or-less solid crust of earth and rock to meet the demands of Honolulu&#8217;s ever expanding growth.
</p><p>To return to our narrative: to this hamlet of Pele-ula, such as <pb id="pb170" n="170"/>it was in the days of Arcadian sweetness&#8212;if not of light&#8212;Hiiaka and her select company now enter as the honored guests of a woman distinguished alike for her beauty, her spiritual subtility and insight&#8212;she was a <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">makaula</hi>&#8212;and for her devotion to pleasure. One of her chief diversions, naturally enough, was the hula, especially that form of the dance which was used in connection with that <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">risqu&#233;</hi> entertainment, the kilu<corr sic=",">.</corr><note id="n198a" lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Wa&#8217;a-hila</hi> is said to have been the name of a favorite hula of Pele-ula; so called after a princess who, with her brother Ka-manu-wai, excelled in the performance of this dance. Her name has been perpetuated in an old saying that has come down to us: <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ka ua Wa&#8217;a-hila o Nu&#8217;uanu</hi>. This is a gentle rain that extends only as far down Nu&#8217;uanu valley as to Wyllie or Judd street.</note>
</p><p>By evening, when the travelers had washed away the encrusting salt, warmed and dried their apparel at an outdoor fire, filled nature&#8217;s vacuum at the generous table of their hostess, while they were sitting in the short gloaming of the tropics, enjoying the delicious content that waits on rest after toil, Pele-ula interrupted the silence:
</p><p>&#8220;The people will have assembled in the hall by this time. Shall we move in that direction?&#8221; Her glance was first at Hiiaka as the leader of the party; her gaze rested on Lohiau.
</p><p>&#8220;Let the resident guests be the first. When they are settled in their places it will be time enough for us to come in,&#8221; was the reply of Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;As you please,&#8221; nodded Pele-ula.
</p><p>Wahine-oma&#8217;o rose to her feet as Pele-ula was departing. At this move Hiiaka said, &#8220;When you reach the hall go and take a seat by your man friend.&#8221; She meant Lohiau. Thereupon she gave vent to this enigmatical utterance:

    </l><l>Remember, I come from Puna.</l></lg><p>The inner meaning and intent of this highly wrought figurative and allegorical language, which Hiiaka, according to her custom, utters at detached intervals in the form of song, does not lie on the surface, and is furthermore obscured by an untranslatable punning use of the word Puna.
</p><p>To explain the motive of this song, Hiiaka perceives that Pele-ula and Lohiau, who had once upon a time been lovers, are mutually drawn to each other by a rekindling of the old flame. In the case of Pele-ula the motive of ambition to match her own spiritual power as a <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">makaula</hi>&#8212;seer&#8212;with that of the young woman who comes to her as the plenipotential ambassador of Pele is even stronger than the physical passion. In the kilu now to be performed she sees her opportunity.
</p><p>She will use it for all it is worth, not only that she may taste once more the delights offered by this coxcomb, but that she may pluck from the hand of this audacious creature of Pele&#8217;s endowment a wreath for her own wearing.
</p><p>As to Lohiau, that plastic thing, his character, is as clay in <pb id="pb173" n="173"/>the hands of the potter, under Pele-ula&#8217;s manipulation. He is all for pleasure. Honor, constancy, ordinary prudence, are not in his purview. Hiiaka&#8217;s immediate presence suffices to restrain and guide him; in her absence, his passion, a rudderless bark, is the sport of every wind that blows.
</p><p>Hiiaka, on arriving at the halau, sat by herself. Lohiau, as she observed, was sitting with Wahine-oma&#8217;o and Waikiki. Pele-ula, who was sitting alone on her side of the hall, now showed her hand by sending one of her men, named A&#8217;ala, to invite Lohiau to come over and sit with her. At this Hiiaka spoke up: &#8220;I will sit by you.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;So be it, then,&#8221; answered Pele-ula. At the same time she muttered to herself, &#8220;But she wasn&#8217;t invited.&#8221;
</p><p>A&#8217;ala, who caught the aside of his mistress, also put in, &#8220;It&#8217;s Lohiau whom she invites.&#8221;
</p><p>At this Hiiaka bravely laid down the rule, which was the accepted one, that the men and the women should sit on opposite sides of the halau; averring that any other disposition would be sure to breed trouble. Pele-ula could not but agree to this and accordingly, Wahine-oma&#8217;o and Waikiki, leaving their seats by Lohiau, came over and sat with Hiiaka and Pele-ula.
</p><p>When the presiding officer of the game&#8212;the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">la anoano</hi><note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">La anoano</hi>, literally, quiet day.</note>&#8212;had called the assembly to order with the well known cry &#8220;<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pu-heo-heo</hi>&#8221; and it came to the placing of the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pahu kilu</hi>&#8212;short pyramidal blocks of wood&#8212;before each one of the players, who sat in two rows facing each other and separated by a considerable interval, Hiiaka objected to the way in which they were placed. A sharp discussion then arose between Pele-ula and Hiiaka, but the younger woman carried the day and won her point.
</p><p>Lohiau had a great and well-deserved reputation as a skilful champion in the game of kilu. When, therefore, it came his turn to hurl the kilu<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b">The kilu, which gave name to the sport, was an egg-shaped dish made by cutting a coconut or small gourd from end to end and somewhat obliquely so that one end was a little higher than the other.</note> and send it spinning across the mat with an aim that would make it strike the pahu, which was its <corr sic="targe">target</corr>, everybody looked for great things and it was openly predicted that he would win every point.
</p><p>Lohiau preluded his play with a song:
<pb id="pb174" n="174"/>
</p><lg id="lg174.1" type="Group"><l>Ke hele la ka au-hula ana<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Au-hula-ana.</hi> When the road along a steep coast is cut off by a precipice with the ocean tossing at its base, the traveler will often prefer to swim rather than make a wide inland detour.

    </l><l>But now!&#8212;I strip from my back
    </l><l>That emblem&#8212;that burden&#8212;of love!
    </l><l>Alas for emblem and love!</l></lg><p>The &#8220;child in the heart that has grown to be a man&#8221; is Lohiau&#8217;s old love for Pele-ula, which now wakes up into new life at the sight of his old flame. The old love has, however, in a sense become a burden. It stands in the way of the new-born affection that has sprung up in his heart for Hiiaka.
</p><p>It was after the chanting of this mele that Lohiau threw his kilu. But, to the consternation of the audience and his own bewilderment, his play was a miss. His aim had been true, his hand steady, the whirling kilu had gone straight on its way as if sure of the mark, then, to the utter amazement of all experts, like the needle of the compass influenced by some hidden magnet, it had swerved and gone wild.
</p><p>Hiiaka, from the other side of the hall, now took her turn at the kilu, with a prelude of song:
<pb id="pb175" n="175"/>
</p><lg id="lg175.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A makani pua ia lalo,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Lalo</hi>, below, to leeward; therefore to the west, meaning Lohiau, who came from the leeward island of Kauai.</note>

</p><lg id="lg175.2" type="Group"><l>A gust of wind from the west

</p><p>At the first throw the kilu hit the wooden block and then, as if not content with its accomplishment, after caroming off, returned like a bee to its blossom, and this action it repeated until it had scored not one but three points. There was the thrill of triumph in Hiiaka&#8217;s tone as she sang again:
</p><lg id="lg175.3" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O ku&#8217;u manawa na&#8217;e ka i hei i ka moe;

    </l><l>And you are my captive, yes you:
    </l><l>Your purpose is foiled, ah, foiled!</l></lg><p>With another prelude of song, Lohiau offered himself for another trial, kilu in hand:
</p><lg id="lg175.5" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>A makani pahele&#8212;hala kou Maile-h&#250;na;

    </l><l>Malamalama no me he ahi lele la,

    </l><l>Heralded, like a shooting star!&#8212;
    </l><l>Fallen, fallen, alas and alas!</l></lg><p>The game has by this time resolved itself into a contest of wits as well as of skill, and the two chief antagonists are&#8212;strange to relate&#8212;Lohiau, the man who was called back from the grave and the woman to whom he owes his life, Hiiaka.
</p><p>As a prelude to her next play Hiiaka gave this song:
</p><lg id="lg176.4" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>I uka kaua i Moe-awakea,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Moe-awakea</hi>, a hill in Puna; here used for its etymological signification&#8212;literally, to sleep at noontime&#8212;which is brought out in the translation.</note>

</p><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s play this time as before was a marvellous show of <pb id="pb177" n="177"/>skill. The kilu seemed possessed with an instinct of attraction for the block that stood as her target. Like a bee that has found a rich honey-flower it returned again and yet again, as if to drain the last particle of sweetness.
</p><p>Before venturing on his last play, Lohiau discarded the kilu he had been using and chose another, thinking thus to change his luck. He also changed the style of his song, adopting the more sensuous form called <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ami honua</hi>,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="b">The <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ami</hi> was a vigorous action of the body, often employed by dancers. Its chief feature was a rotation of the pelvis in circles of elipses. Though sometimes used with amorous intent, it was not necessarily an attempt to portray sexual attitudes. The <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ami honua</hi>, or <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ami ku&#8217;u pau</hi>, was an exaggerated action of the same description.</note> or <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ku&#8217;u pau</hi>:

    </l><l>Kou aloha ho&#8217;i, e-e!</l></lg><p>In the first line of this little song, Lohiau, skilfully playing on the name Pele-ula, which he turns into Ka-ula, under the figure of the ocean tossing about that little island, banters the woman for her display of passion. In the second line, using a similar word-play, by which he turns his own name into <corr sic="Nii-hau">Niihau</corr>, he contrasts the calm of the latter island with the agitation of the former.

The audience was dumbfounded. In the failure to find excuse sufficient for the occasion, it took refuge in silence.
</p><p>It only remains for Hiiaka to pluck the fruit which her skill has put within reach of her hand. Her complete victory has become a foregone conclusion. Of that there can be no question. It is, however, a question of great interest to the spectator how she will use her victory, in what terms she will celebrate her triumph over the woman and the recreant man who have combined their wits against hers. The answer to this question is to be found in the song with which she preludes her last play:

</p><p>And yet again, when Hiiaka has made the final shot that fulfills the promise of victory to her, still relentlessly wielding the sharp blade of irony, she gives it an extra twist in the wound that must have made Pele-ula wince:

</p><p>The forfeit paid by Lohiau after his defeat was a dance, which he did with inimitable grace and aplomb to the accompaniment of a spirited song, his costume being the customary pa&#252; of the hula:

As to which one of them it was that he singled out as the center of his orbit for the time, that is to be deduced from a study of his song:

Hiiaka could not but admire the pathetic artistry of Lohiau, yet she remained the mistress of her emotions. Pele-ula, in contrast, became visibly more excited at Lohiau&#8217;s close approach. Turning to the younger woman, she said, &#8220;do you respond to this man&#8217;s appeals?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;What is it you mean?&#8221; quietly asked Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;Can it be that you are not stirred by his protestations?<corr sic="&#8221;"/> Put your hand on my bosom,&#8221; said Pele-ula, &#8220;and feel the throbbing of my heart.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka convinced herself of the truth of the assertion and, in turn, said, &#8220;Do you also lay your hand here and judge of my temper.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;You are as cool as a ti leaf,&#8221; exclaimed Pele-ula, &#8220;while I am as hot as a bundle of luau.&#8221;
</p><p>This interchange of attentions between the two women did not escape Lohiau. It inflamed him to another passage of song:

    </l><l>Ah, mine the master&#8217;s lunge!</l></lg><p>From his very nature Lohiau was not qualified to reckon with the supernatural side of Hiiaka. His appeals had been on the plain of human passion&#8212;such appeals as would have subdued and won the heart of an ordinary woman. Still acting under these limitations, Lohiau aimed and shot the arrow that emptied his quiver of song:

He stood before her waiting her fateful decision. Will she consent to turn the canoe-prow and fly back to Kaua&#8217;i with him? He had won the woman&#8217;s heart in her, but not the deity that controlled her nature. The chain that bound her to the Woman of the Pit was too strong to be broken by any mere human appeal. Lohiau had failed in his play with the kilu; he now saw that he had also failed in his attempt to play with this human heart. The game was up; he sat down.
</p><p>When Lohiau had retired in defeat, it became the turn of Wahine-oma&#8217;o to entertain the company&#8212;Wahine-oma&#8217;o, faithful, rustic soul, that she was, whose only acquaintance with this fine art was what she had picked up from seeing the performances of her mistress and master. Her wits did not desert her and were equal to the occasion: best of all, she had the wit to recognize her own limitations. Instead of pitching her song to some far-fetched hyperbole, she travestied the whole performance in a wholesome bit of nonsense that drifts down to us across the centuries as a most delicious take-off:
</p><lg id="lg184.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O ku, o ka o Wahine-oma&#8217;o.

Her dancing was a grotesque ambling and mincing from one side of the theater to the other. The unaffected good humor of the girl robbed the arrow of her wit of all venom while detracting not one whit from its effectiveness.
</p><p>Towards morning the audience made clamorous demands that Hiiaka, the woman whom their suffrage had declared to be the most beautiful that had ever stood before them, should present herself before them once again. Hiiaka willingly responded to this encore:

At the proper psychological moment, with the wreath of victory crowning her brow, while Pele-ula was vainly intent on an effort to turn the tide of her own defeat and gain the shadow of a recognition as mistress of the game of Kilu, Hiiaka, with a significant gesture to her companions, spat upon the ground and, her example having been imitated by Wahine-oma&#8217;o and Lohiau, their physical bodies were at once transported to a distance while their places continued to be occupied by unsubstantial forms that had all the semblance of reality.</note></head><p>Hiiaka, having&#8212;by her marvellous skill&#8212;extricated her charge from the toils of the enchantress, turned a deaf ear to Pele-ula&#8217;s urgent persuasions to abide yet longer and taste more deeply the sweets of her <corr sic="hospitaliay">hospitality</corr>. Her determination arrived at, she wasted no time in leave-taking but made all haste to put a safe distance between the poor moth and the flame that was the focus of his enchantment. Their route lay eastward across <pb id="pb186" n="186"/>the dusty, wind-swept, plain of Kula-o-kahu&#8217;a&#8212;destined in the coming years to be the field of many a daring feat of arms;&#8212;then through the wild region of Ka-imu-ki, thickset with bowlders&#8212;a region at one time chosen by the dwarf Menehune as a sort of stronghold where they could safely plant their famous <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">ti</hi> ovens and be unmolested by the nocturnal depredations of the swinish Kama-pua&#8217;a. Hiiaka saw nothing or took no notice of these little rock-dwellers. Her gaze was fixed upon the ocean beyond, whose waves and tides they must stem before they reached and passed Moloka&#8217;i and Maui, shadowy forms that loomed in the horizon between her and her goal.
</p><p>Hiiaka, standing on the flank of Leahi and exercising a power of vision more wonderful than that granted by the telescope, had sight of a wild commotion on her beloved Hawaii. In the cloud-films that embroidered the horizon she saw fresh proof of her sister&#8217;s unmindfulness of the most solemn pledges. It was not her fashion to smother her emotions with silence:
</p><lg id="lg186.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Ke ahi maka-pa<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Maka-pa</hi>, an expression used of stones that burst when placed in the fire.</note> i ka la, e;

</p><lg id="lg186.2" type="Group"><l>The fire-split rocks bombard the sun;
    </l><l>The fires roll on to the Puna sea;
    </l><l>There&#8217;s brightness like day at Kuki&#8217;i;
    </l><l>Ghosts of night at the eastern gate,

The answer was a surly refusal, coupled with the remark that Hiiaka would better do her own fishing. As the sister and representative of the proud god Pele, Hiiaka could not permit the insult to go unpunished. Her reply was the utterance of this fateful incantation:
</p><lg id="lg187.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>He makani holo uh&#225;<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Makani <corr sic="holo-uha">holo ul&#225;</corr>.</hi> The allusion is to a cold wind that chills the naked legs of the fisher-folk.</note>

    </l><l>Pau wale ke aho i ka noi ana,
    </l><l>O ka loa ho&#8217;i, e!</l></lg><p rend="class(transh)">TRANSLATION
</p><lg id="lg187.2" type="Group"><l>Here&#8217;s a blast shall posset the blood,
    </l><l>As the chant of kahuna the back.
    </l><l>Our patience exhausts with delay;
    </l><l>We&#8217;re famished from the length of the way.</l></lg><p>The magic words operated quickly. As Hiiaka turned to depart, the unfortunate fishing women fainted and died.
</p><p>After this outburst of retribution, Hiiaka turned aside to address in words of consolation and compliment two forlorn mythical creatures whom she recognized as kindred. They were creations of Pele, Ihihi-lau-akea, manifest to us to-day as a lifeless cinder-cone, and Nono-ula, as a clear spring of water welling out of the mountain. It was a nice point in Hiiaka&#8217;s character that she was always ready, with punctilious etiquette, to show courtesy to whom courtesy was due.
</p><p>Fortunately for Hiiaka, her lofty perch afforded a wide-embracing view that included the shadowy forms of Maui and the lesser islands that nested with it. Not the smallest pirogue could steal away from the strip of rocky beach at her feet without her observation. At this moment she caught sight of two sailor-men in the act of launching a trim canoe into the troubled waters <pb id="pb188" n="188"/>of the Hanauma cove, and she made haste, accordingly, to come to them, on the chance of securing a passage, if so be that they were voyaging in the desired direction. Their destination proving to be Moloka&#8217;i, Hiiaka begged the men to receive herself and party as passengers. Nothing loath, they gave their consent.
</p><p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said one of them, &#8220;your party by itself is quite large enough to fill the canoe.&#8221;
</p><p>His companion, with better show of cheer in his speech, spoke up and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s but common luck to be swamped in this rough channel. To avoid it needs only skill. Even if the craft swamps, these people need not drown; we can swim for it, and we shall all fare alike. We&#8217;ll take you with us. Come aboard.&#8221; Aboard they went.
</p><p>The voyage to Moloka&#8217;i proved uneventful. They landed at Iloli, a barren place that offered no provision to stay their hunger. When Hiiaka, therefore, learned that these same canoe-men were bound for the neighboring island of Maui, she wisely concluded to continue the voyage with them.
</p><p>On landing in Kohala, Hiiaka took the road that led up through the thickly wooded wilderness of Mahiki, the region that had been the scene, now some months gone, of the most strenuous chapter in her warfare to rid Hawaii of the mo&#8217;o&#8212;that pestilent brood of winged and crawling monsters great and small that once infested her wilds and that have continued almost to the present day to infest the imagination of the Hawaiian people. On coming to the eminence called Pu&#8217;u O&#8217;ioina,&#8212;a name signifying a resting place&#8212;being now in the heart of the damp forest of Moe-awa, they found the trail so deep with mire that the two women drew up their pa&#252; and tucked them about their waists. At sight of this action, Lohiau indulged himself in some frivolous jesting remarks which called out a sharp rebuke from Hiiaka.
</p><p>As they cleared the deep woods, there burst upon them a view of the Hamakua coast-wall here and there dotted with clumps of puhala and fern, at intervals hung with the white ribbons of waterfalls hastening to join the great ocean. As Hiiaka gazed upon the scene, she uttered her thoughts in song:
</p><p>(In literature, as in other matters, the missing sheep always makes a strong appeal to the imagination. Urged by this motive, I have searched high and low for this mele, the utterance of Hiiaka under unique conditions; but all my efforts have been unavailing.)
</p><p>When they had passed through the lands of Kukia-lau-ania <pb id="pb189" n="189"/>and Maka-hana-loa and were overlooking the town of Hilo, Hiiaka was better able to judge of the havoc which the fires of Pele had wrought in her Puna domains. The land was desolated, but, worst of all, the life of her dearest friend Hopoe had been sacrificed on the altar of jealousy. In her indignation, Hiiaka swore vengeance on her sister Pele. &#8220;I have scrupulously observed the compact solemnly entered into between us, and this is the way she repays me for all my labor! Our agreement is off: I am free to treat him&#8212;as my lover, if I so please. But it shall not be here and now. I will wait till the right occasion offers, till her own eyes shall witness her discomfiture.&#8221;
</p><p>After this outburst, her thoughts fashioned themselves in song:

No explanation would suffice. Pele persisted in regarding them as deserters and, at her command, they were put to death.



<pb id="pb191" n="191"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch33" n="XXXIII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XXXIII</head><head>HIIAKA ALONE WITH LOHIAU</head><p>It has come at last, the situation to which the logic of events has for many days pointed the finger of a relentless fate. For the first time Hiiaka finds herself alone with Lohiau. The history of her life during the past two months seems but a prologue to the drama, the opening scene of which is about to be enacted in the dressing room, as we must call it. For Hiiaka, having gathered a lapful of that passion-bloom, the scarlet lehua, and having plaited three wreaths, with a smile on her face, hangs two of the wreaths about the neck of Lohiau, using the third for her own adornment.
</p><p>They are sitting on the sacred terrace of Ka-hoa-lii, at the very brink of the caldera, in full view of the whole court, including the sisters of Hiiaka who gather with Pele in the Pit. &#8220;Draw nearer,&#8221; she says to Lohiau, &#8220;that I may tie the knot and make the fillet fast about your neck.&#8221; And while her fingers work with pliant art, her lips quiver with emotion in song:
</p><lg id="lg191.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O Hiiaka ka wahine,
    </l><l>Ke apo la i ka pua;
    </l><l>Ke kui la, ke u&#246; la i ka manai.

</p><lg id="lg191.2" type="Group"><l>&#8217;Twas maid Hiiaka plucked the bloom;
    </l><l>This wreath her very hands did weave;
    </l><l>Her needle &#8217;twas that pierced each flower;
    </l><l>Her&#8217;s the fillet that bound them in one.
    </l><l>Four strands of lehua make the lei&#8212;
    </l><l>The wreath bound on by this maid&#8212;
    </l><l>Maid who once basked in the calm down there:
    </l><l>Her heart harks back to Hilo-one;
    </l><l>Wreath and heart are for Hilo-one.</l></lg><p>The wreath is placed, the song is sung, yet Hiiaka&#8217;s arm still clasps Lohiau&#8217;s neck. Her lithesome form inclines to him. With <pb id="pb192" n="192"/>a sudden motion, Hiiaka throws her arms about Lohiau and draws him to herself. Face to face, lip touches lip, nose presses nose.
</p><p>The women of Pele&#8217;s court, chokefull of curiosity and spilling over with suspicion, watchful as a cat of every move, on the instant raise their voices in one Mother-Grundy chorus: &#8220;Oh, look! Hiiaka kisses Lohiau! She kisses your lover, Lohiau!&#8221;
</p><p>The excitement rises to fever heat. Pele is the coolest of the lot. At the first outcry&#8212;&#8220;they kiss&#8221;&#8212;Pele remarks with seeming indifference, &#8220;The nose was made for kissing.&#8221;<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a">&#8220;I hana ia ka ihu i mea honi.&#8221;</note> (The Hawaiian kiss was a flattening of nose against nose). But when Hiiaka and Lohiau sink to the earth wrapped in each other&#8217;s arms, and the women of Pele&#8217;s court raise the cry, &#8220;For shame! they kiss; they embrace!&#8221; At this announcement, the face of Pele hardens and her voice rings out with the command: &#8220;Ply him with fire.&#8221;
</p><p>From Pele&#8217;s viewpoint, the man, her lover, Lohiau was the sinner. The role played by the woman, her sister, Hiiaka&#8212;the one who had, in fact, deliberately planned this offensive exhibition of insubordination and rebellion&#8212;was either not recognized by Pele or passed by as a matter of temporary indifference. Hiiaka&#8217;s justification in motives of revenge found no place in her reasoning.
</p><p>When the servants of Pele&#8212;among them the sisters of Hiiaka&#8212;found themselves under the cruel necessity of executing the edict, they put on their robes of fire and went forth, but reluctantly. In their hearts they rebelled, and, one and all, they agreed that, if, at close view, they found him to be the supremely handsome mortal that fame had reported him to be, they would use every effort to spare him. On coming to the place, their admiration passed all bounds. They could not believe their eyes. They had never seen a manly form of such beauty and grace. With one voice they exclaimed:
</p><lg id="lg192.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>Mahina ke alo,
    </l><l>Pali ke kua.
    </l><l>Ke ku a ke kan&#225;ka maikai,

    </l><l>So stands the handsome man,
    </l><l>This man on thy terrace, Hoa-lii.</l></lg><pb id="pb193" n="193"/><p>Pele&#8217;s fire-brigade went through the form of obeying their orders. They dared not do otherwise. Acting, however, on their preconcerted plan, they contented themselves with casting a few cinders on the reclining form of Lohiau and, then, shamefaced, they ran away&#8212;an action that had the appearance of reproof rather than of punishment.
</p><p>The effect on the mind of Hiiaka, whose insight into the character of Pele was deeper than that of Lohiau, was far different from that of mere admonition or reproof. She recognized in the falling cinders a threat of the direst import and at once braced herself to the task of averting the coming storm and of disarming the thundercloud that was threatening her lover. &#8220;Have you not some prayer to offer?&#8221; she said to Lohiau.
</p><p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, and at her request he uttered the following:

One of the numerous avatars or characters of Kane. He appeared in Kahiki&#8212;Kukulu o Kahiki&#8212;and gained a reputation as a benevolent deity, whose benign function&#8212;shared by Kane-milo-hai&#8212;was to pluck from the jaws of death those who lay at the last gasp (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">mauli-awa</hi>), or whose vital spark was at the last flicker (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pua-aneane</hi>). He healed the palsied, the helpless and hopeless, those who were beyond the reach of human aid. On one occasion he restored himself to perfect health and soundness by the exercise of his own will; hence his name, Kane-apua. On another occasion he illustrated his power by restoring to life some okuhekuhe which the fisherman had already scaled and laid upon the fire. The motive for this act seems to have been that this fish was a form in which he sometimes appeared. The story of his adventure with Kane-lelei-aka is worthy of mention. At one time while standing on a headland that reached out into the ocean like the prow of a ship, his eye caught a gleam from something moving swiftly through the water. He saw it repeatedly passing and repassing and wondered what it was. It was the shadowy form of Kane-lelei-aka, but he knew it not. He scanned the surrounding mountains and cliffs, if perchance he might get sight of the body, bird, or spirit that produced this reflection. He discovered nothing. In pursuit of his quest, he started to go to Kukulu-o-Kahiki. On the way he met his relative Kane-milo-hai, out in mid <corr sic="ovean">ocean</corr>.
</p><p>&#8220;Are you from Kanaloa?&#8221; asked Kane-milo-hai. That meant are you from Lana&#8217;i, Kanaloa being the name formerly given to that little island.
</p><p>&#8220;Aye, I am from Kanaloa and in pursuit of a strange shadowy thing that flits through the ocean and evades me.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to recognize that it is only a shadow, a reflection. The real body is in the heavens. What you are pursuing is but the other intangible body, which is represented by the body of Kane-mano. He is speeding to reach his home in <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ohe-ana</hi>&#8221; (a cave in the deep sea, in the Kai-popolohua-a-Kane).
</p><p>&#8220;How then shall I overtake him?&#8221; asked Kane-pua.
</p><p>&#8220;You will never succeed this way. You are no better off than a kolea (plover) that nods, moving its head up and down (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">kunou</hi>). Your only way is to return with me and start from the bread-fruit tree of Lei-walo (<hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ka ulu o Lei-walo</hi>). You must make your start with a flying leap from the topmost branch of that tree. In that way you can come up to him and catch him.&#8221;
</p><p>The rest of the story: how he followed the advice given him by Kane-milo-hai and succeeded is too long for insertion here.</p></note> i ke one lau a Kane;

The phrase <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">o ka la</hi> affixed to her name discountenances the idea that she is the one here intended. It becomes evident that the whole expression means rather the many eyes of the Sun, i.e., the many rays that dart from the Sun; and this is the way I construe it.</note> maka o ka La o Hu&#8217;e-ehu&#8217;e,

</p><p>As she spoke the fire-lake in Hale-ma&#8217;u-ma&#8217;u took on a ruddier hue, lifted in its cauldron and began to boil furiously, spouting up a score of red fountains.
</p><p>&#8220;Men, gods, take these fires and pour them upon the man,&#8221; said Pele, addressing Lono-makua, Ku-pulupulu, Ku-moku-halii, Ku-ala-na-wao, Kupa-ai-ke&#8217;e, Ka-poha-kau, Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai and many others.
</p><p>The gods well knew on what perilous ground they stood, with whom they had to deal, the fierceness of Pele&#8217;s wrath when it was stirred; yet, in their hatred of a great wrong, they moved with one purpose to push back the fires that were threatening Lohiau. With their immortal hands they flung away the embers and masses of flame until the heavens were filled with meteor-fragments.
</p><p>Pele&#8217;s wrath rose to a mighty heat at this act of mutiny and disloyalty and she cursed the whole assembly. &#8220;Go,&#8221; said she, &#8220;back to Huli-nu&#8217;u whence you came. Let the land on which you stand remain barren and yield no harvest nor any food for mortal or for immortal.&#8221;
</p><p>Now Pele was one of the chief gods on earth. The land was hers. Did she not make it? Her authority extended also to heaven. Did not her flames mount to the zenith? All the gods, even the great gods Ku, Kane, Kanaloa and Lono, depended on her for certain things. When she voyaged from Kahiki to the new land of Hawaii they were constrained to follow her. Not because of any command she laid upon them did they do this, but because such was their inclination. Where Pele was there was food, wealth, the things they had need of. They followed as a dog tags after its master.
</p><p>The threat made by Pele was, then, no idle breath. It was a thing of terrible moment&#8212;to be stripped of their fat offices and banished to a far-off barren land, a terrible sentence. Some of the gods gave in at once and made their peace with the terrible goddess. Of those who stood firm in their opposition were Ku-moku-hali&#8217;i, Ku pulu-pulu, Ku-ala-na-wao, Kupa-ai-ke&#8217;e and Ku-mauna.<note id="n201x" lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="x"><p><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ku-mauna</hi>, a rain-god of great local fame and power; now represented by a monolithic bowlder about thirty feet high, partly overgrown with ferns and moss, situated in the lower edge of the forest-belt, that lies to the south and Kau of Mauna-loa, deserves more than passing mention. The region in which this rock is situated is declared by vulcanologists to have been one vast caldera and must have been the scene of tremendous disturbances.
</p><p>Up to the present time the Hawaiians have continued to hold Ku-mauna in great reverence mingled with fear. The following modern instance is<pb id="pb212n" n="212"/>not only a true story, and interesting, but also furnishes an illustration of the attitude of mind of the Hawaiian people generally,&#8212;or many of them&#8212;towards their old gods.
</p><p>During a period of severe drought in the district of Kau, Hawaii, a gentleman named S&#8212;&#8212;, while hunting in the neighborhood of the rock that bears the name Ku-mauna, took occasion to go out of his way and visit the rock. Standing before the rocky mass and calling it by name, he used towards it insulting and taunting epithets, professing to hold it responsible for the drought that was distressing the land. He concluded his tirade by discharging his rifle point blank against the face of the rock, resulting in the detachment of a considerable fragment.
</p><p>The vaqueros in the employ of Mr. S.&#8212;&#8212;, who were assisting in the hunt, horrified at the sacreligious act, at once put spurs to their horses and made off, predicting the direst consequences from the rash act of Mr. S&#8212;&#8212;.
</p><p>Now for the denouement: Within about ten days of this occurrence, the valley, on one side of which Mr. S&#8212;&#8212; had his residence, was visited by a violent rain-storm&#8212;such as would in popular speech be termed a cloud-burst. There was a mighty freshet, the waters of which reached so high as to flood his garden and threaten the safety of his house, which he saved only by the most strenuous exertions. The land which had been his garden was almost entirely washed away and in its place was deposited a pell-mell of stones.
</p><p>Needless to say, that, by the natives, this incident was and is regarded to this day as conclusive evidence of the divine power of Ku-mauna and of his wrath at the audacious person who insulted him. Special significance is attached to the fact that as part of Ku-mauna&#8217;s reprisal the place that had been a garden was turned into a field of rocks. The only wonder is that Mr. S&#8212;&#8212; got off with so light a punishment.</p></note> Condemned to banishment, they were indeed in a <pb id="pb202" n="202"/>sorry plight. They found themselves on the instant deprived of their jobs and of their power. Food they had not, nor the means of obtaining it; these were in the possession of Kane and Kanaloa. The ocean was not free to them; it was controlled by Ka-moho-alii. In their extremity they became vagabonds and took to the art of canoe-making. Thus were they enabled to fly to other lands.
</p><p>New dispositions having been made and fresh stratagems set on foot, Pele turned loose another deluge of fire, Lono-makua consenting to manage the operation. The fire burst into view at Keaau, from which place it backed up into the region of Ola&#8217;a and there divided into two streams, one of which continued on the Hilo side, while the other followed a course farther towards Kau. Lohiau, thus surrounded, would find himself obliged to face Pele&#8217;s wrath without the possibility of retreat.

The master passion came <pb id="pb214" n="214"/>to the front and had sway: she would find Lohiau, and with him renew the bond of friendliness which had grown up in the midst of the innocent joys and toils of travel shared by them in common. An access of divine power came to her. She immediately began to tear up the strata of the earth. As she broke through the first stratum and the second, she saw nothing. She tore her way with renewed energy: rock smote against rock and the air was full of flying debris.
</p><p>After passing the third stratum, she came upon a ghastly sight&#8212;the god of suicide, suspended by the neck, his tongue protruding from his mouth. It was a solemn lesson. After passing the fourth stratum she came upon the stratum of Wakea, and here she found the inanimate bodies of her former companions of travel, the faithful Wahine-oma&#8217;o and Pa&#250;-o-pala&#8217;e. She restored them to life and animation, bidding them return to the beautiful world of sunshine and fresh air.
</p><p>She came at last to the tenth stratum with full purpose to break up this also and thus open the flood-gates of the great deep and submerge Pele and her whole domain in a flood of waters. That, indeed, would have been the ruin of all things. At this moment there came to <corr sic="Hiaaka">Hiiaka</corr> the clear penetrating tone of a familiar voice. It was the voice of her fast friend and traveling companion, Wahine-oma&#8217;o, who had but recently left her and who, now, under the inspiration of the great god Kane, had come to dissuade Hiiaka from her purpose. For the execution of that purpose meant a universe in confusion. It was time, then, for Kane to interfere. He did this by putting into the mouth <corr sic="of of">of</corr> her dearest friend on earth an appeal to which Hiiaka could not but listen and, listening, heed:

</p><p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; said Wahine-oma&#8217;o; &#8220;let us return to our mistress.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;I must first seek and find Lohiau,&#8221; answered Hiiaka.
</p><p>&#8220;Better for us first to go before Pele. She will send and bring Lohiau.&#8221; Thus pleaded the woman Wahine-oma&#8217;o.
</p><p>Hiiaka turned from the work of destruction and, hand in hand, they made their way back into the light and wholesome air of the upper world.
</p><p>The sisters&#8212;those who bore the name Hiiaka&#8212;received her cordially enough. They prattled of many things; buzzed her with questions about her travels of long ago&#8212;as it now seemed to Hiiaka. It was not in their heart to stir the embers of painful issues. No more was it in their heart to fathom the little Hiiaka of yesterday, the full-statured woman of to-day. Beyond the exchange of becoming salutations, Hiiaka&#8217;s mouth was sealed. Until Pele should see fit to lend ear and heart to her speech not a word would she utter regarding her journey.
</p><p>But Pele lay on her hearth silent, sullen&#8212;no gesture, no look of recognition.
</p><p>The kino wailua, or spirit from Lohiau, in the meantime, after having in vain tried to solace itself with the companionship of the forest song-birds and having found that resource empty of human comfort, fluttered across the desolate waste of ocean like a tired sea-bird back to his old home and there appeared to his aikane Paoa in a vision at night.
</p><p>&#8220;Come and fetch me,&#8221; he said (meaning, of course, his body). &#8220;You will find me lying asleep at Kilauea.&#8221;
<pb id="pb216" n="216"/></p><p>Paoa started up in a fright. &#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;That Lohiau is in trouble?&#8221;
</p><p>When he had lain down again the same vision repeated itself. This time the command was imperative: &#8220;Come and rescue me; here I am in the land of non-recognition.&#8221;<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a"><hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">E ki&#8217;i mai oe ia&#8217;u; eia au la i ke au a ka hewahewa.</hi></note>
</p><p>Now Paoa roused himself, assured that Lohiau&#8217;s sleep was that of death, but not knowing that he was, for the second time, the victim of Pele&#8217;s wrath. He said nothing to anyone but made all his preparations for departure in secret, reasoning that Kahua-nui, the sister of Lohiau, would not credit his story and would consequently interfere with his plans.
</p><p>He entered his canoe and, pressing the water with his paddle, his craft made a wonderful run towards Hawaii. It was necessary for him only to dip his paddle in the brine at intervals and to direct the course. The canoe seemed almost to move of itself<corr>.</corr> That same morning he arrived at Waipio. To his astonishment, there, in a boat-shed on the beach lay the canoe which he recognized as that of his friend Lohiau. The people of the district had been wondering whose it was and how it had come there.
</p><p>Paoa found many things that were new and strange to him in this big raw island of Hawaii. Not the least of these was the land on which he trod, in places a rocky shell covering the earth like the plates on the back of the turtle, or, it might be, a tumble of jagged rocks&#8212;the so-called a&#228;&#8212;a terrain quite new to his experience. It seemed as if the world-maker had not completed his work.
</p><p>Of the route to Kilauea he was quite ignorant, but he was led. There flitted before him a shadow, a wraith, a shape and he followed it. At times he thought he could recognize the form of Lohiau and, at night or in the deep shadows of the forest, he seemed to be looking into the face of his friend.
</p><p>When night came he lay down in a sheltered place and slept. In the early morning, while darkness yet brooded over the land, he was roused by the appearance of a light. His first thought was that day had stolen upon him: but no, it was the kino wailua of his friend that had come to awaken him and lead him on the last stage of his journey.

The wraith dissolved into nothingness as he approached the spot; but there lay a figure in stone having the semblance of a man. It was more an act of divination than the exercise of ordinary judgment that told him this was the body of Lohiau. &#8220;I thought you had summoned me to take home your living body, my friend!&#8221; was his exclamation.

This pale variety shows a faint pink or reddish ring about the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">maka</hi>, or eye where the flower was implanted.

Looking down into the desolate abyss, his gaze centered on a group of human figures, beautiful women, seated on the vast plates of pahoehoe that made the floor of the caldera. He saw but four of them, Pele herself not being visible. He had no clue as to their identity and was only impressed as by the sight of beautiful women who were to him as goddesses. The grandeur and strangeness of the scene moved him to song:

</p><p>&#8220;Call to him and invite him to come down here where we can talk together,&#8221; said Pele. &#8220;Way up there on the pali wall&#8212;that&#8217;s no place for us to talk and become acquainted with each other. Tell him to come down here and we&#8217;ll discuss matters great and small, look upon the large stem and the small stem; see one another face to face; learn each other&#8217;s heart&#8217;s desire.&#8221;<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a">Aohe o kahi nana oluna o ka pali.

</p><p>For all her fine words. Pele did not at once come forward and meet her visitor face to face. She lay unrecognized in her stygian boudoir, to all appearance a withered hag.
</p><p>Paoa, well versed in the wiles of Woman, adept in the logomachies and etiquettes of court-life, was quite put to his trumps and found it necessary to summon all his diplomacy and exercise <pb id="pb227" n="227"/>all his power of self-command in dealing with the shrewd and attractive women that surrounded him. It was evident to the watchful eye of our heroine&#8212;Hiiaka&#8212;that he was dangerously attracted by the voluptuous beauty of her sister, Hiiaka-of-the-waves. In the persistent silence of Pele, upon her fell the leading part of the conversation with Paoa:
</p><p>&#8220;What might be the purpose of your pilgrimage?&#8221; she asked.
</p><p>&#8220;I come in answer to the call of my friend, Lohiau.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;But Lohiau is dead,&#8221; chorused the women.
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, dead! And what was the cause of his death?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;He kissed Hiiaka,&#8221; the woman answered.
</p><p>&#8220;Ah! but who killed him?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Pele.&#8221; Her voice sank to a whisper, and the name she uttered was to be made out, or guessed at, rather by a study of the protruding lips and the sympathetic arching of the brow than by any sound emitted. Her eyes also made a half-turn in the direction of Pele&#8217;s cave.
</p><p>&#8220;He came to Hawaii in the expectation that Pele would be his life.&#8221; Paoa spoke with thoughtful deliberation. &#8220;How came it about that she should cause his death?&#8221; ... After a moment&#8217;s pause, he continued: &#8220;He tasted death once at Haena and, now, again, here, on this barren ... a second death, and through the wrath of Pele!&#8221;
</p><p>Pele roused herself at this and spoke up: &#8220;What is that you say? that Lohiau died at Haena?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Yes, he tasted of death there,&#8221; Paoa answered firmly.
</p><p>&#8220;How, then, did he become alive again?&#8221; asked Pele sharply.
</p><p>&#8220;Hiiaka, she treated him, and by her gracious skill and power brought his soul and body together again. That done, they sailed away for Hawaii.&#8221;
</p><p>The eyes of Pele were literally, as well as metaphorically, opened. She turned herself about and, in a lowered voice, with a show of astonishment, for the first time, addressed Hiiaka: &#8220;Is this true, that you worked over Lohiau and restored him to life?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;It is true, and it is also true that, not until you had put to death Hopoe, did I bestow any dalliance or caress of love upon Lohiau.&#8221;
</p><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s expression as she faced Pele was such as might have sat upon the countenance of a judge passing sentence on a confessed criminal at the bar.
</p><p>Pele sat impenetrable, sphinxlike, deep in her own labyrinthine <pb id="pb228" n="228"/>philosophy of the obligations due to a social autocrat and a goddess.
</p><p>Paoa broke the silence: &#8220;Shall not Lohiau, then, live again?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;Go back to Haena,&#8221; said Pele, &#8220;and when you hear that Lohiau lives again, then will be the time for you to come and take him home.&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;That would be well, then,&#8221; said Paoa.
</p><p>A spell of confusion, of enchantment, seemed now to fall upon the man whilom so boastful. &#8220;But where is Pele?&#8221; he asked, looking from face to face.
</p><p>&#8220;That is Pele,&#8221; said the goddess, pointing to her sister Wave (Hiiaka-i-ka-ale-i).
</p><p>&#8220;I have a sign by which I may know Pele; let me apply the test to these women,&#8221; said Paoa.
</p><p>The company could but agree to this; whereupon, beginning with Wave, he took each one of them in turn by the hand, carrying it to his cheek, the better to test its warmth, holding the hollow to his ear to catch any murmur that might reverberate from it. Each hand he found to be only of natural heat. Turning, then, to Pele herself, he proposed to inspect her hand. At this the goddess drew back.
</p><p>&#8220;If none of these beautiful women is Pele, how can you think that a wrinkled old woman like me is the divine and beautiful Pele?&#8221;
</p><p>Paoa insisted and Pele had to consent. He reached out and took her hand and, on the instant, dropped it; it was burning hot.
</p><p>&#8220;This is Pele!&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p><p>Paoa stood in awed silence before the goddess. Resentment and thoughts of revenge, like evil birds, had taken flight.
</p><p>At Pele&#8217;s command, the women led him away to take refreshment in the sacred dining hall of Mauli-ola. Before seating himself, Paoa uttered this memorable pule, a mele that has drifted down to us from the <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">wa po</hi><corr>:</corr>

Its literal meaning may be given as sacred (or tabu<corr>)</corr> pillar. Mr. Tregear, in his incomparable <hi>Maori Comparative Dictionary</hi>, gives one meaning of the word to be sanctuary. One thoughtful Hawaiian defines it as a pillar, such as Pele set up, due regard for which demanded silence. Another, equally well informed, defines it as an edict, or canon.

In an old mele occurs this line: <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">O ke anuenue ke ala o Kaha&#8217;i.</hi> The rainbow was the path of Kaha&#8217;i.</note> hele, he ala muku,

Paoa&#8217;s argument&#8212;if he can be said to have had any&#8212;seems to be that Pele should cast away, throw into the ocean, the lumber of old laws and tabus and start afresh.
</p><p>Before leaving the subject&#8212;the consideration of the mele&#8212;I must mention, apropos of the expression <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">pahu kapu a ka leo</hi>, in verse 54, an incident related to me by a Hawaiian friend (J. M. P.). He says that when he was a boy, his mother, when a thunder-storm arose, would often say to him, &#8220;keep silence! that&#8217;s Kane-hekili.&#8221; In Kahuku, island of Oahu, at a place not far from the sugar-mill, is a cave, known as <hi lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keana</hi>. In former times this cave was the home where lived a mother and her two sons. One day, having occasion to journey to a distance, she left them with this injunction, &#8220;If during my absence you hear the sound of thunder, keep still, make no disturbance, don&#8217;t utter a word. If you do it will be your death.&#8221; During her absence, there sprang up a violent storm of thunder and lightning, and the young lads made an outcry of alarm. Thereupon a thunderbolt struck them dead, turning their bodies into stone. Two pillar-shaped stones standing at the mouth of the cave are to this day pointed out in confirmation of the truth of the legend.
</p><p>As Paoa concluded his prayer-song the eyes of the whole company were turned upon him, and on the lips of them all was the question, &#8220;Was she then your God?&#8221;
</p><p>&#8220;She is my God,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and my ancestors from the earliest times have worshipped her.&#8221; ... Then, turning his eyes about him, as if to survey the land, he continued, &#8220;If this were my land, as is Kaua&#8217;i, there would be no lack of good and wholesome food-provision, and that of all kinds. Things are different here ... I am a stranger in this land.&#8221;
</p><p>On hearing these words, which had in them the sting of truth, for poison had been mixed with some of the food, the women stealthily hid away certain dishes and substituted for them others.
</p><p>At the conclusion of the repast the women who had been in attendance brought him a girdle delicately embroidered with fibers from the coconut that he might be suitably appareled for his interview with the woman Pele. &#8220;You will find,&#8221; they said, &#8220;that Pele is in reality a woman of wonderful beauty.... In order to win her, however, you will need to use all your arts of fascination ... and your caution as well. Make hot love <pb id="pb234" n="234"/>to her, but, look out! don&#8217;t let your fancy lead you to smile upon any other beauty.&#8221;
</p><p>Pele at first kept Paoa at a distance and, with deep subtlety, said to him, &#8220;Here are beautiful women&#8212;women more beautiful than I&#8212;take one of them.&#8221;
</p><p>Paoa, well schooled in courtly etiquette and logomachy, was not tripped up by any such snare as Pele laid for him. He stood his ground and faced the god as an equal.
</p><p>As Pele contemplated Paoa it dawned upon her that here stood a man, a being of gracious power, one who combined in himself qualities&#8212;attractions&#8212;she had never before seen materially embodied in the human form. The woman in Pele laid aside the god&#8212;the akua&#8212;and came to the front<corr>.</corr> All thought of bantering talk and word-play slunk away: her whole being was sobered and lifted up. The change in her outward, physical appearance kept pace with the inward: the rough armor that had beset her like the prongs of horned coral, both without and within, melted and dropped away; the haglike wrinkles ceased to furrow her profile. Her whole physical being took on the type of womanly perfection.
</p><p>And what of Paoa, the man who had come with heart full of bitterness, determined on revenge? He was conquered, overwhelmed.
</p><p>Their meeting was that of lovers, who stood abashed in each other&#8217;s presence. Pele&#8217;s beauty and charm were like that of a young bride coming to the nuptial couch....
</p><p>The dalliance and love-making of Pele and Paoa was a honeymoon that continued for three days and three nights. By virtue of this mysterious union with the goddess, Paoa acquitted himself of a ceremonial duty, as it were, and thus gained Pele&#8217;s dispensation from further obligations to her bed and the liberty of exercising free choice among all the beautiful women that thronged Pele&#8217;s court. It was there he made his abode until the time for his return to his own Kaua&#8217;i.



<pb id="pb235" n="235"/></p></div1><div1 id="ch38" n="XXXVIII" type="Chapter"><head type="label">CHAPTER XXXVIII</head><head>HIIAKA AND LOHIAU ... A REUNION</head><p>Hiiaka&#8217;s sense of outrage touched every fiber of her being and stirred such indignation against her sister that she could not again take her former place as a member of Pele&#8217;s court. Hawaii was the largest island of the group, but it was not large enough to hold herself and Pele. Of all the islands Kaua&#8217;i was the one most remote from the scene of her troubles; it was also the land which Lohiau had claimed as his own&#8212;and his was a name that called up only the most tender emotions. To Kaua&#8217;i would she go.
</p><p>The company of those who shared her feelings and whose personal attachment to her was sufficient to lead them with herself in a venture of new fortunes was not large. It included, of course, her two staunch attendants, Pau-o-pala&#8217;e and Wahine-oma&#8217;o and, strangely enough, a considerable quota of the sisters who shared with her the name Hiiaka (qualified though it was in each case by some additional distinguishing epithet). Towards Kaua&#8217;i, then, did they set their faces or, more literally, turn the prow of their canoe.
</p><p>Many unforeseen things, however, were to happen before the God of Destiny would permit her to gain her destination. Other strands stood ready to be interwoven with the purposeful threads Hiiaka was braiding into her life.
</p><p>In the ancient regime of Hawaii, the halau, as the home and school of the hula, stood for very much and for many things. It served, after a fashion, as a social exchange or clearing house for the whole nation; the resort of every wandering minstrel, bohemian soul or <hi lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau esprit</hi> whose oestrus kept him in travel; the rallying point of souls dislocated from an old and not yet accommodated to a new environment; a place where the anxious and discouraged, despairing of a new outlook, or seeking balm for bruised hearts, might quaff healing nepenthe.
</p><p>It is not to be wondered at, then, that Hiaaka, not yet healed of her bruises, on reaching Oahu and finding herself in the peaceful haven of Kou, should turn her steps to the home of that hospitable siren and patroness of the hula Pele-ula, as to a sanitarium or hospital whose resources would avail for the assuagement of her troubles. It was almost an article of Pele-ula&#8217;s creed that in the pleasures and distractions of the hula was <pb id="pb236" n="236"/>to be found a panacea for all the wounds of the spirit; and Pele-ula, as if taking her cue from the lady of the Venusberg, offered her consolations generously to every comfort-needing soul that fared her way.
</p><p>Hiiaka stepped into the life at Pele-ula&#8217;s court as if she had been absent from it for only a day. Madame Pele-ula, good sport that she was, bore no grudge against the woman who had outplayed her at every turn, and would do it again. She received Hiiaka with open arms. As to entertainment, the play was the <corr sic="thing thing">thing</corr> and that, fortunately, was already appointed for the same evening. It was the same old performance, the hula kilu, with but slight change in the actors and with full opportunity for Hiiaka to display her marvelous skill in hurling the kilu.
</p><p>It was Hiiaka&#8217;s play and she, following the custom of the game, was caroling&#8212;in sober strain&#8212;a song of her own; when, to her astonishment, a voice from the crowd struck in and carried the song to completion in the very words that would have been her&#8217;s. Hiiaka stood and listened. The voice had a familiar ring; the song was not yet in the possession of the public, being known only to a few of her own household, among whom was to be reckoned Lohiau. There was no avoiding the conclusion: it was Lohiau.
</p><p>It remains to tell the miracle of Lohiau&#8217;s reappearance among men in living form and at this time. While the body of Lohiau lay entombed in its stony shroud, his restless spirit fluttered away and sought consolation in the companionship of the song-birds that ranged the forests of Hawaii.
</p><p>When the magician La&#8217;a, who lived in Kahiki, contemplated the degraded condition of Lohiau, alienated from all the springs of human affection, living as a wild thing in the desert, he determined on his rescue and despatched Kolea (plover), one of his ancestral kupuas, to fetch him. The mission of Kolea was not a success. The voice, the manner, the arguments of the bird made no appeal to Lohiau; they were, in fact, distasteful to him and rather increased his devotion to his other bird-friends.
</p><p>&#8220;Well, Kolea, what sort of a place is Kahiki?&#8221; asked Lohiau.
</p><p>&#8220;A most charming place,&#8221; he answered, nodding his head and uttering his call, &#8220;Ko-l&#233;-a, Ko-l&#233;-a.&#8221;
</p><p>Lohiau was disgusted with his performances and would have nothing more to do with Kolea.
<pb id="pb237" n="237"/></p><p>When Kolea returned and reported his failure to La&#8217;a, that magician sent another bird on the same errand, one of more seductive ways, Ulili. There was something in the voice and manner of Ulili that touched the fancy and won the heart of Lohiau at once and he began to follow him. Ulili skilfully lured him on and at last brought him to Kahiki and delivered him over to his master. La&#8217;a ministered to the soul of Lohiau with such tenderness and skill that he became reconciled once more to human ways. But the soul of Lohiau still remained an unhoused ghost, and at times ranged afar in its restless excursions.
</p><p>Now it happened that at the very time when these events were taking place Kane-milo-hai, an elder brother of Pele, was voyaging from Kahiki to Hawaii. His canoe was of that mystical pattern, the leho (cowry) in which Mawi had sailed. While in the middle of the I&#235;i&#235;-waho channel he caught sight of the distracted spirit of Lohiau fluttering like a Mother Carey&#8217;s chicken over the expanse of waters. The poor ghost, as if desirous of companionship, drew nigh and presently came so near that Kane-milo-hai captured it and, having ensconced it in his ipu-holoho-lona,<note lang="en" xml:lang="en" n="a">A calabash, often covered with a net, used by a fisherman to hold his spare hooks and lines and, by the traveler, his belongings.</note> he sailed on his way.
</p><p>Reaching Hawaii and coming to the desolate scene of Lohiau&#8217;s tragedy, he recognized a charred heap as the former bodily residence of the shivering ghost in his keeping. He broke the stony form into many pieces and then, by the magical power that was his, out of these fragments he reconstructed the body of Lohiau, imparting to it its original form and lineaments. Into this body Kane-milo-hai now introduced the soul and Lohiau lived again.
</p><p>The tide of new life surging in the veins of Lohiau stirred in him emotions that found utterance in song:
</p><lg id="lg237.1" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>I ola no au i ku&#8217;u kino wailua,
    </l><l>I a&#8217;e&#8217;a mai e ke &#8217;lii o Kahiki,

</p><lg id="lg238.1" type="Group"><l>I lived, but &#8217;twas only my soul;

    </l><l>New life has come to Lohiau!
    </l><l>To Lohiau, aye, to Lohiau!</l></lg><p>Having come to himself, Lohiau sought his own. His chancing at Kou and his appearance at the halau in which Pele-ula was holding her kilu performance, and on the very evening of Hiiaka&#8217;s arrival, was an arrangement of converging lines that reflected great credit on the god of Destiny.
</p><p>Lohiau arrived at the kilu hall just in time to witness the opening of the game. Having seated himself quietly in the outskirts of the assembly, he begged a neighbor to permit him, as a favor, to conceal himself under the ample width of his kihei, exacting of him also the promise not to betray his retreat. Thus hidden, he could see without being seen. The sight of Hiiaka, the words of her song&#8212;he had heard them a score of times before&#8212;stirred within him a thousand memories. Without conscious effort of will, the words of his response sprang from his heart almost with the spontaneity of an antiphonal echo. Let us bring together the two cotyledons of this song:
</p><lg id="lg238.2" lang="haw" xml:lang="haw" type="Group"><l>O ka wai mukiki a&#8217;ala lehua o ka manu,
    </l><l>O ka awa ili lena i ka uka o Ka-li&#8217;u,

    </l><l>Oh the pangs of the Pit, Kilauea!

</p><p>This was accomplished the reunion of Hiiaka and Lohiau, and thus it came to pass that these two human streams of characters so different, in defiance of powerful influences that had long held them apart, were, at length, turned into one channel&#8212;that of the man, not wholly earthly, but leavened with the possibility of vast spiritual attainment under the tonic discipline of affliction; that of the woman, self-reliant, resourceful, yet acutely in need of affection; human and practical, yet feeling after the divine, conscious of daily commerce with the skies; and, yet, in spite of all, in bondage to that universal law which gives to the smaller and weaker body the power to introduce a perturbation into the orbit of the greater and to pull it away from its proper trajectory.
</p><p>The old order has passed away, the order in which the will of <pb id="pb240" n="240"/>Pele has ruled almost supreme, regardless of the younger, the human, race which is fast peopling the land that was hers in the making. Hitherto, surrounded by a cohort of willing servants ready at all times to sacrifice themselves to her caprice,&#8212;behold, a new spirit has leavened the whole mass, a spirit of dissent from the supreme selfishness of the Vulcan goddess, and the foremost dissident of them all is the obedient little sister who was first in her devotion to Pele, the warm-hearted girl whom we still love to call Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele.
